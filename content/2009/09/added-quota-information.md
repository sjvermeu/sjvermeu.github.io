I've added quota support information to the [Linux
Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/) book as well as information
about the eclean command for cleaning distfiles and packages. The part
on building a Linux kernel has been moved into its own
[chapter](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/ch07.html), the chapter on
[hardware support](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/ch08.html) now has a
bit more information about dealing with sound cards (ALSA support) and
will contain information about sound servers in the near future. This
chapter will also be used to configure the various other hardware things
as they come by (printers, scanners, ...).
