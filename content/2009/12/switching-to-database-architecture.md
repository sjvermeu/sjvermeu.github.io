It's finally committed: I'm going to dive into the realms of database
architecture. It's with some sentiment that I'm leaving the expertise
field of Apache, J(2)EE and WebSphere, but seeing the database
architecture field makes it up well. I'm starting to get acquainted with
Oracle DB as first platform and IBM DB2 + Microsoft SQL Server are
pending. Exciting times are coming!
