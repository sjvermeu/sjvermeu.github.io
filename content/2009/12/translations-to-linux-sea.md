Slug: translations-to-linux-sea

A few people have contacted me if they were allowed to translate the
online book I'm writing ([Linux Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea)).
Of course they are, the license allows it. However, I recommend to wait
a bit. At this moment, I'm not going to release the docbook sources (I'm
not writing it in DocBook, but I'm generating from another XML into
DocBook) until I'm happy with the final result.

I'm glad to see that the document is well received. There is still lots
of work on it (more excercises, a thorough spelling / grammar check,
elaborate on certain topics, ...) so stay tuned for further updates. Why
are those updates "slow"? Well, let's say that I use a "fair share
scheduling" principle on all my hobbies ;-)
