My everlasting document, [Linux Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea),
is progressing slowely but surely. I've started a few new chapters and
also initiated a chapter on [Installing
Gentoo](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/ch15.html) (which is more a
shortlist of tasks with pointers to earlier chapters).

I also took a different CSS (docbook.css file used by the FreeBSD
handbook) as it looks a lot better.
