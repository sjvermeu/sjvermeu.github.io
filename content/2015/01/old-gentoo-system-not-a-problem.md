If you have a very old Gentoo system that you want to upgrade, you might
have some issues with too old software and Portage which can't just
upgrade to a recent state. Although many methods exist to work around
it, one that I have found to be very useful is to have access to old
Portage snapshots. It often allows the administrator to upgrade the
system in stages (say in 6-months blocks), perhaps not the entire world
but at least the system set.

Finding old snapshots might be difficult though, so at one point I
decided to create [a list of old
snapshots](http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/snapshots/), two months apart,
together with the GPG signature (so people can verify that the snapshot
was not tampered with by me in an attempt to create a Gentoo botnet). I
haven't needed it in a while anymore, but I still try to update the list
every two months, which I just did with the snapshot of January 20th
this year.

I hope it at least helps a few other admins out there.
