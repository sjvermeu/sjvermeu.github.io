A short while ago I got the notification that pulling new CVE information was
no longer possible. The reason was that the NVD site did not support uncompressed
downloads anymore. The fix for cvechecker was simple, and it also gave me a reason
to push out a new release (after two years) which also includes various updates by
Christopher Warner.

So [cvechecker 3.6](https://github.com/sjvermeu/cvechecker/wiki) is now available
for general consumption.
