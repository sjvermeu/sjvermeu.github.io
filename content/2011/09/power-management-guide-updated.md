The [Gentoo Power Management
Guide](http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/power-management-guide.xml) is now
updated. It is a full rewrite, focusing currently on two main toolsets:
[Laptop Mode Tools](http://samwel.tk/laptop_mode/) and
[cpufreqd](http://www.linux.it/~malattia/wiki/index.php/Cpufreqd). I was
pleasantly surprised by the number of features that the laptop mode
tools package provided.

Of course, this does not mean that the guide is now finished.
Documentation never is, so do keep on suggesting improvements (and
pointing to bugs) in [Gentoo's bugzilla](https://bugs.gentoo.org).
