Title: SELinux for Gentoo Hardened

Recently, most of the SELinux-related ebuilds from the hardened overlay
have been moved to the official Portage tree. Hopefully, this will
trigger more people / organizations to try Gentoo Hardened with SELinux
and help us improve the ebuilds. They're still marked as \~arch (as they
should be). The draft [SELinux handbook](http://goo.gl/DlHJD) has been
updated to reflect this and I'm currently performing a few greenfield
installations using the documentation again to verify if everything
still works as it is supposed to. In the meantime, I'm scripting these
things so that I can automate these tests and run those at night in the
future ;-)
