Title: About time...

I was just wondering why "UTC" stood for "Coordinated Universal Time".
Apparently (okay, citing
[Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/UTC) here, so
be critical), it's of two main reasons: English and French speaking
folks that were participating in that discussion wanted their language
to be presented in the abbreviation (English wants "CUT - Coordinated
Universal Time", French "TUC" - Temps Universel Coordonn√©), so a
consensus was taken to use "UTC" which gladly followed another time
convention (UT1, UT2, ... for universal time notations - which is the
second reason).

Little did I know that it is UTC that has leap seconds (sometimes you
hear in the news that the last minute of a year lasts 61 seconds)
whereas UT1 (which is the modern notation for GMT) doesn't.

All that because I read about a meeting taking place at 2000 UTC...
