A few minutes ago, I stabilized both the 2.20110726 policies as well as
the SELinux userspace utilities that were stable (upstream) on 20110727.
With the change, I also updated the [Gentoo SELinux
Handbook](http://hardened.gentoo.org/selinux/selinux-handbook.xml) with
the changes I presented on our
[gentoo-hardened](http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-hardened/msg_73ddd74112bef0007f361f3598140a21.xml)
mailinglist. After some time, I'll remove the now obsoleted older
policies and userspace utilities to keep the tree in a sane state.

There are a few policy packages whose stabilized version isn't the
latest (cfr earlier post), those are due within the proper designated
period (about 1 month).
