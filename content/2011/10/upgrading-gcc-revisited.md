Title: Upgrading GCC, revisited

Gentoo has, since long, had a GCC Upgrading guide. A long time ago,
upgrading GCC required quite a lot of side activities and was often
considered a risky upgrade. But times change, and so do the GCC upgrade
cycles. Improved compatibility as well as a better understood impact
made GCC upgrades a lot less painful. Sadly, our documentation didn't
reflect that as much - the last update on the GCC Upgrade guide was from
2008.

Today, after some [clarifications from
gentoo-dev](http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_62dbadfe0175cdf96a7751f69d2f5af7.xml),
I've [updated the GCC Upgrading
Guide](http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gcc-upgrading.xml) to reflect the
improved situation. I'm hoping this will help clear out the uncertainty
surrounding GCC upgrades. As always, comments and feedback are always
welcome.
