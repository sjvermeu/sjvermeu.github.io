I just uploaded a new release of [cvechecker](http://cvechecker.sf.net)
to the project files. The release is a (long overdue) bugfix release,
but includes two small enhancements: support standard input for the
binary list (so you can pipe the output of one command to cvechecker)
and the introduction of the `CVECHECKER_CONFFILE` variable to refer to
another location for the configuration file.

Big thanks to [Anne Mulhern](http://mulhern-at-yocto.dreamwidth.org/)
for the various patches submitted!
