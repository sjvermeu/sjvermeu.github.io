Slug: selinux-tutorial-series-update

Just a small update - the [set of SELinux
tutorials](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Tutorials) has been
enhanced since my last blog post about it with information on SELinux
booleans, customizable types, run-time modi (enforcing versus
permissive), some bits about unconfined domains, information on policy
loading, purpose of SELinux roles, SELinux users and an example on how a
policy works regarding init scripts.

The near future will give more information about the multi-level
security aspect, about multi-category support, a review on the SELinux
context (as we then have handled each field in the context string) and
i'll also start with the second series that focuses more on policy
enhancements and policy building.

And probably a few dozen more. Happy reading!
