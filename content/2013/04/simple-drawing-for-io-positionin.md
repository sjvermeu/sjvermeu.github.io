Instead of repeatedly trying to create an overview of the various layers
involved with I/O operations within Linux on whatever white-board is in
the vicinity, I decided to draw one up in [Draw.io](http://www.draw.io)
that I can then update as I learn more from this fascinating world. The
drawing's smaller blocks within the layers are meant to give some
guidance to what is handled where, so they are definitely not complete.

So for those interested (or those that know more of it than I ever will
and prepared to help me out):

I hope it isn't too far from the truth.
