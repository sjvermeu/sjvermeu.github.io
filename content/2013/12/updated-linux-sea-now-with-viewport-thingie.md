I just pushed out an update to [Linux
Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/) (an online resource to introduce
you to Linux, using Gentoo Linux as an example), including its PDF and
ePub versions. The changes are pretty small (see its
[ChangeLog](https://github.com/sjvermeu/Linux-Sea/blob/master/ChangeLog)).

Together with the update, it now also includes a
`<meta name="viewport"...>` so that the document renders better on a
mobile device. Not perfect, but at least it's not small text anymore
where you need to pinch-zoom and then scroll left/right all over the
place. Same with my blog btw.
