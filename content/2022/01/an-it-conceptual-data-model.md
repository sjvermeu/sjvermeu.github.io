This time a much shorter post, as I've been asked to share this information
recently and found that it, by itself, is already useful enough to publish. It
is a conceptual data model for IT services.

**The IT model, and why it is useful**

A conceptual data model for IT services supports several IT processes, with a
strong focus on *asset management* and *configuration management*. Many IT
vendors that have solutions active within those processes will have their own
data model in place, but I often feel that their models have room for
improvement.

Some of these models are too fine-grained, others are limited to server
infrastructure. And while most applications allow for further customization, I
feel that an IT architect should have a conceptual model in mind for their
actions and projects.

The conceptual data model that I'm currently working on looks as follows:

![An IT CDM, first version]({static}/images/202201/it-cdm-v1.png)

My intention is to update this CDM with new insights when I capture those. It is
not my intention to further develop the data model into a physical data model,
but perhaps in the long term I could make it a conceptual one (explaining what
the attributes are of each concept).
