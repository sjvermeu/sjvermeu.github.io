I sadly had to miss out on the FOSDEM event. The entire weekend was filled with
me being apathetic, feverish and overall zombie-like. Yes, sickness can be cruel.
It wasn't until today that I had the energy back to fire up my laptop.

Sorry for the crew that I promised to meet at FOSDEM. I'll make it up, somehow.
