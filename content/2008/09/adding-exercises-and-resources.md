Title: Adding exercises and resources

As stated earlier, I'm now focusing on the existing content of my
(work-in-progress) ebook called Linux Sea
([PDF](http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/linux_sea.pdf),
[HTML](http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/linux_sea/)). I'm going to add more
text where appropriate, add exercises to each chapter as well as
references to online resources.

When that's finished, I'll probably be writing a chapter on installing
Gentoo Linux as that's a major end-user topic that isn't discussed yet
(but luckily, there's still the [Gentoo
Handbook](http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/)).
