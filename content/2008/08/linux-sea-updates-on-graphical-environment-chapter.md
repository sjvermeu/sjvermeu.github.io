I've updated the chapter on [graphical
environments](http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/linux_sea/c2990.htm) a bit to
reflect how applications, window managers, X server and widget toolkits
work together. Hopefully it isn't a big lie that I wrote there ;-)

I'll probably be doing a bit of clean ups the coming days before I start
out with more chapters...
