Some time ago I received a digital camera; however, due to diskspace
shortage I need to clean up my home directory. One of the directories
that eats most of my sectors is one where I store all my pictures.

I know I have a lot of duplicate pictures, pictures deduced from master
pictures (lower resolution, some editing) and similar pictures (same
scene taken 4 or 5 times with different camera settings, hoping to get
at least one good shot) but managing them wasn't easy.

I now played a bit with [gqview](http://gqview.sourceforge.net/) and
this tool seems to provide some features I find very interesting; one of
them is the "find duplicates" where you can even search for pictures
with "similar" content and I must say that it does work. Of course,
nothing is perfect, but I've managed to clean up the picture directory
so it works for me.
