The [Gentoo Wiki folks](https://wiki.gentoo.org) have started a great
idea (and immediately set a nice milestone), namely the [Gentoo Wiki
Summer of
Documentation](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki:Summer_of_Documentation/2012).
By september, they want to double the amount of articles on the wiki.

I'll surely help out and participate where I can, and perhaps we can
even go far above the targeted 500 articles!
