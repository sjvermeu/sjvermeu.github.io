Title: Linux Sea now in ePub

On request of Matthew Marchese, I now automatically build an [ePub
version](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/linux_sea.epub) of [Linux
Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea) for those that like to read such
resources on a digital reader. Thanks to the use of DocBook, this was
simply a matter of using its xsl-stylesheets/epub/docbook.xsl stylesheet
against the DocBook sources and zip the created directory structures
(OEBPS and META-INF) to get to the ePub file.
