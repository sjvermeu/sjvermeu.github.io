Title: Documentation updates for initramfs needed?

A quick help request from the community: if you know of any Gentoo
documents that need updates in order for end users to know when and how
to use initramfs, please file [bugreports](https://bugs.gentoo.org) and
have them [block bug
\#407959](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407959). Currently, we
have updated the Gentoo Handbook, Gentoo Quickinstall guides and added
an Initial ramfs Guide.

The tracker bug is also used to check if and when the eventual roll-out
of software can happen, and we want to make sure that we do not forget
documentation (something we learned from the openrc migration). Not that
the change is as large as was the case with openrc, but it is still nice
to have updated documentation in time ;-)
