Personalia
----------

My name is Sven Vermeulen, born in Bruges (Belgium) on the 5th of
September in 1982. I am currently employed as an enterprise architect
with responsibility on the infrastructure domain (strategy, evolution
and standardization within both on premise and cloud) at [KBC
Group](http://www.kbc.com) and am living happily in Mechelen, a city
near Brussels (also Belgium).

I'm a heavy proponent of the Free Software movement. I'm an active
[Gentoo Linux](http://www.gentoo.org) user (a Linux meta-distribution)
and have published a few books about SELinux.

Most of my hobbies are computing-related: security (both mathematical
approach and conceptual), system-level programming, processes and
automation development. I like to be a know-it-all, checking out how
stuff works and why it sometimes doesn't ;-)
