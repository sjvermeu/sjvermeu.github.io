Do you ever write down things in the hope you never forget them, but
still think it would be better if you could somehow take a test of that
subject from time to time to make sure you don't forget?

I do, and I found it quite difficult to keep the knowledge live without
having to reread the things every now and then. For that purpose, I
started writing a simple JavaScript/XML/XSL fileset that allowed me to
present questions (randomly if necessary) from a structured set of
questions. In the beginning, it was too simple to share (string
matching) but quickly grew to something more elaborate: regular
expression support, multiple string-answer support, in-paragraph answer
boxes and single/multiple choice answers.

With this fileset in place, I can keep track of things I would most
likely otherwise forget: just select the category which I want to take a
test from, and start with a (lot of) random question(s).

I've decided to put this fileset
[online](http://swift.siphos.be/tools-quizzer.html) (including
[demo](http://swift.siphos.be/tools/quizzer/quizzer.html) files) and
will extend the demo file with questions regarding my book, [Linux
Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/), allowing readers of the book to
take online tests after they've finished a chapter.
