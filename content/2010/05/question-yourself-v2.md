Slug: question-yourself-v2

A new version of the
[Quizzer](http://swift.siphos.be/tools-quizzer.html) webscript is
available. The [demo](http://swift.siphos.be/tools/quizzer/quizzer.html)
has also been updated with quick tests on the first few chapters of
Linux Sea.

More exercises on the following chapters will follow soon.

Updates to the script include visual accept/reject of single-choice and
multiple choice answers and improved support for Internet Explorer
(which I don't have at home to validate).
