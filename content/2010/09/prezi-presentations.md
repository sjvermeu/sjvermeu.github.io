While doing some research on current rich internet applications / web
application platforms, I discovered an online presentation site/tool
called [Prezi](http://www.prezi.com). This online application allows you
to make dynamic presentations differently from the standard presentation
software like [OpenOffice.org's
Impress](http://www.openoffice.org/product/impress.html). A nice example
can be found
[online](http://prezi.com/hgjm18z36h75/why-should-you-move-beyond-slides/)
as well of course. I think I'm going to try this out in the near future
;-)
