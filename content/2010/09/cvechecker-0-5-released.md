Slug: cvechecker-0-5-released

A new intermediate release of
[cvechecker](http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net) is now released. The
tool is reported to build properly on NetBSD and FreeBSD as well
(although much user experience there is still welcome), introduces a
**cvereport** command ([example
output](http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net/example/report.html)), has
lowered its initial dependency requirements and **pullcves** now only
loads the CVE XML changes in the database, rather than iterating across
all CVE XML entries.

Many thanks to Nigel Horne for his continuous testing/hammering on the
tool.
