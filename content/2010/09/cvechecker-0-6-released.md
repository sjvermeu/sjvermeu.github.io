Slug: cvechecker-0-6-released

This release makes me quite happy, because it resolves one major PITA I
had (performance), but you know how things go. If it works fine for the
developer, it's probably an abomination for the rest of the world.
Anyhow, [cvechecker](http://cvechecker.sf.net) version 0.6 is now
available. It improves reporting performance tremendously if your sqlite
library is sufficiently up-to-date, now supports reporting on found
software (regardless if it matches a CVE entry or not) and adds quite a
few bug fixes along the way.
