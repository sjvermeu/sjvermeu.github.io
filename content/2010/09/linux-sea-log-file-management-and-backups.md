I've added two more chapters to the [Linux
Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea) book. The first one is about [Log
file management](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/ch17.html), the second
one about [Taking Backups](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/ch18.html).
They're far from finished, but I thought that those two topics are
important for day-to-day Gentoo usage and shouldn't be left out of the
Linux Sea saga.
