The last chapter in [Linux Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea)
focuses on [Using A Shell](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/ch19.html).
This seems to me like a nice last chapter, as it confronts the user with
the exciting world of shell scripts. I hope that the chapters in the
book are sufficiently stuffed so that beginners (who are not afraid to
learn) can more easily start off with (Gentoo) Linux. Of course, this is
just the beginning. The existing content needs to be sharpened, extended
where needed, updated, etc. so expect a few updates coming along!
