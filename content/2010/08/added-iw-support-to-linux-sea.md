Title: Added "iw" support to Linux Sea

The wireless driver developers are actively working on a [new wireless
toolset called
"iw"](http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw), slowly
deprecating the older wireless-tools toolset (which contains the
"iwconfig" command). Kasumi\_Ninja reported to me in the [Gentoo
Forums](https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-6310061.html#6310061) that
it would be nice to add information on iw to [Linux
Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea), so I did. I must admit though
that my systems don't (or hardly) support iw, so I had to be lead by
examples throughout the Internet.

Apart from the iw addition, I've reorganized the sections on [Software
Management](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/ch09.html) as it was
becoming too crowded. I've also started a
[ChangeLog](http://github.com/sjvermeu/Linux-Sea/raw/master/ChangeLog)
for those who want to track the changes to the document.

Now if anyone can recommend me a good spell- and grammar checker...
