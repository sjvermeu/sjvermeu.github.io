My current personal projects, [Linux
Sea](http://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea) and
[cvechecker](http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net), are actively being
watched by the free software community. For the Linux Sea book, I get
nice feedback and ideas on the [Gentoo
Forums](https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-812252.html) and on the
cvechecker application, people such as Nigel Horne are helping out in
various ways - including [feature
requests](http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net/docs/featurerequests.html)
of all sorts.

I must admit, I remain impressed.

Small changes have already been squeezed in in the Linux Sea document. A
larger change (the use of the [iw
tools](http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw) for
wireless connectivity) is being investigated (sadly, [my broadcom-sta
device](http://blog.siphos.be/2010/08/new-laptop-time-to-play/) doesn't
support the new nl80211 API so the documentation change is slower to
integrate than expected). I'm also planning to make some updates on the
software management chapter as it is currently becoming quite crowded.

In the cvetool, most
[changes](http://cvechecker.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cvechecker/ChangeLog?view=markup)
are bugfixes and output enhancements as expected. I'm not going to add
more functionality now - I first want to get a stable 1.0 release out
there. But first continue to squash bugs and add rules to the
versions.dat file so that it is usable on various systems (release 0.4
is around the corner).
