Slug: cvechecker-0-3-released

Time for a new intermediate
[cvechecker](http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net) release, so here it is.
Changes include (beyond the usual bugfixes) different CSV output (with
some sort of version support) so that it can be easily used for
reporting purposes, removal of debugging/verbose items and added example
files for reporting.
