Slug: cvechecker-0-4-released

Albeit with less updates than 0.3 had, [cvechecker
0.4](http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net) brings in internal project files
reorganization (more to the liking of the GNU autoconf/automake
standards - I think), fixes a databaseleak (instead of memoryleak ;-)
bug and introduces a teenie weenie bit more intelligent pullcves command
(with multiple return code behavior to improve automation efforts) as
was mentioned in the feature request list. All documentation is also
updated and a pullcves manual page has been added.
