Slug: cvechecker-1-0-released

With only a few small bugfixes between this release and the previous
one, [cvechecker 1.0](http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net) has finally
been released. It runs fine on my few systems and I have not gotten any
bugreports from other users anymore. It can definitely need more rules
to identify installed software (those rules are released separately)
which is what I will focus on the few upcoming weeks. Once that has been
accomplished, I will start with the alpha releases for the 2.0 series
using the [feature
requests](http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net/docs/featurerequests.html)
as a guideline.

I plan on maintaining the earlier versions of cvechecker for two
consecutive releases - one including small functional enhancements (as
long as they can be applied on the development release and the stable
release easily) and one just for security and bug fixes.
