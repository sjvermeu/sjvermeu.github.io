For a personal <abbr title="Proof Of Concept">POC</abbr> I wanted to see
if it is possible to generate, based on the collection of CVE entries
publicly available, a report informing a system administrator about
possible vulnerabilities. Nothing fancy, just based upon versions.

A simple example: tool detects Perl, acquires installed Perl version,
then matches the collection of CVE entries against this Perl version. If
at least one CVE is found, report it. The idea is then to make this as
generic as possible (not specific for an operating system or Linux
distribution), so not use a package version but really the tool version
(or library version).

Of course, whenever I am planning such minor POCs, I search the Internet
for possible existing tools (just like [kev009 describes - "But First,
Write No
Code"](http://www.kev009.com/wp/2010/05/but-first-write-no-code/)). And
I found out that there are already quite some "foundation components"
available...

-   [CPE](http://cpe.mitre.org) is a structured way of naming software
    (vendor, title, version ...)
-   [OVAL](http://oval.mitre.org) is a method for performing structured
    tests (like regular expression matches in text) for reporting
    purposes

Many more of these efforts are linked through the Mitre sites. The above
two are the most important ones though - it seems that it might be
possible to use OVAL to describe the tests I wanted for the POC.

To be continued...
