Today, IBM generously hosted the [GSE TWS BeLux 2010
conference](http://www.gsebelux.com/?q=node/101). Although it was
organized together with the GSE DB2 conference (which I would also have
loved to attend) I must say I was pretty impressed with the topics
given, especially those after the lunch.

For me, personally, the topic on TWS 8.5.1 with broker functionality was
most impressive. Not that the features are extremely innovative, but
they are very useful (especially in an enterprise context). I don't know
if you have (production) experience with TWS Broker (or even 8.5.1's
broker functionality) - if you do, I'd love to hear about it!
