While still working on a few other projects, one of the time consumers of the
past half year (haven't you noticed? my blog was quite silent) has come to an
end: the [SELinux System Administration - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/selinux-system-administration-second-edition)
book is now available. With almost double the amount of pages and a serious
update of the content, the book can now be bought either through Packt Publishing
itself, or the various online bookstores such as [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SELinux-System-Administration-Sven-Vermeulen-ebook/dp/B01LWM02WI).

With the holidays now approaching, I hope to be able to execute a few tasks
within the Gentoo community (and of the Gentoo Foundation) and get back on track.
Luckily, my absence was not jeopardizing the state of [SELinux](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux)
in Gentoo thanks to the efforts of Jason Zaman.
