Content-wise, the move is done. I've done a few checks on the content to
see if the structure still holds, translations are enabled on all pages,
the use of partitions is sufficiently consistent for each architecture,
and so on. The result can be seen on [the gentoo handbook main
page](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page), from which the
various architectural handbooks are linked.

I sent a [sort-of
announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.project/4141)
to the gentoo-project mailinglist (which also includes the motivation of
the move). If there are no objections, I will update the current
handbooks to link to the wiki ones, as well as update the links on the
website (and in wiki articles) to point to the wiki.
