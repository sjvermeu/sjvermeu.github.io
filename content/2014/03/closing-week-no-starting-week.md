Title: Closing week? No, starting week...

I've been away for a while, and this week will (hopefully) be the last
week of all the effort that is causing this. And that means I'll get
back to blogging, documentation development, SELinux integration,
SELinux policy development and more. To be honest, I'm eagerly awaiting
this moment of getting back on my feet.

That doesn't mean it's been silent the last few months. A few days ago,
the Reference Policy made a new release of the policy. For Gentoo, that
won't be a major update as we already follow the reference policy (git
repository) quite closely with our policy packages. I'll hopefully merge
the last few changes and bump the version on the Gentoo policy packages
as well soon.

The Gentoo wiki has seen quite a few updates. I tried to approve most of
the translation-ready changes a few days ago. Those that I didn't do I
should get feedback on (through the Talk/Discussion pages) in the next
week.

And then on to the huge backlog of issues on bugzie...
