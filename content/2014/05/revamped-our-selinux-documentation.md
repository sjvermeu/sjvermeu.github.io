In the move to the [Gentoo wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org), I have
updated and revamped most of our SELinux documentation. The end result
can be seen through the [main SELinux
page](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux). Most of the content is
below this page (as subpages).

We start with a new [introduction to
SELinux](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Quick_introduction)
article which goes over a large set of SELinux' features and concepts.
Next, we cover the various concepts within SELinux. This is mostly
SELinux features but explained more in-depth. Then we go on to the user
guides. We start of course with the [installation of SELinux on
Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Installation) and then
cover the remainder of administrative topics within SELinux (user
management, handling AVC denials, label management, booleans, etc.)

The above is most likely sufficient for the majority of SELinux users. A
few more expert-specific documents are provided as well (some of them
still work in progress, but I didn't want to wait to get some feedback)
and there is also a section specific for (Gentoo) developers.

Give it a review and tell me what you think.
