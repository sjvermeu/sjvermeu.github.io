Title: Multilib in Gentoo

Slug: multilib-in-gentoo

One of the areas in Gentoo that is seeing lots of active development is
its ongoing effort to have proper [multilib
support](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Multilib) throughout the
tree. In the past, this support was provided through special emulation
packages, but those have the (serious) downside that they are often
outdated, sometimes even having security issues.

But this active development is not because we all just started looking
in the same direction. No, it's thanks to a few developers that have put
their shoulders under this effort, directing the development workload
where needed and pressing other developers to help in this endeavor. And
pushing is more than just creating
[bugreports](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=454644) and telling
developers to do something.

It is also about
[communicating](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/91125),
[giving
feedback](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/91770) and
patiently helping developers when they have questions.

I can only hope that other activities within Gentoo and its potential
broad impact work on this as well. Kudos to all involved, as well as all
developers that have undoubtedly put numerous hours of development
effort in the hope to make their ebuilds multilib-capable (I know I had
to put lots of effort in it, but I find it is worthwhile and a big
learning opportunity).
