      <h:p>
        Welcome to the configuration baseline of the &technology; technology.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
        (high level introduction to what the technology is or does)
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
        In order to provide a stable, secure and manageable offering, this document tackles the technical setup of this technology and acts as a standard for its implementation. Any exception or deviation from this document has to be approved on the appropriate level, which is defined by the scope of each rule.
      </h:p>
    </description>
    <Group id="xccdf_&revComp;_group_introduction-scope">
      <title>Rule scope, exceptions and deviations</title>
      <description>
        <h:p>
          Within this document, configuration items are documented through rules. Each rule has a scope associated with it, which provides insight in the impact of the rule on the environment. This impact defines also where exceptions or deviations, if needed, can be granted.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>
          The following scope definitions are used.
        </h:p>
        <h:dl>
        	<h:dt>application</h:dt>
	        <h:dd>
	        	The impact of the rule is expected to be solely on the application level for which this technology is being used. As such, an exception or deviation from this rule can be taken by the application/service owner.
	        </h:dd>
	        <h:dt>instance</h:dt>
	        <h:dd>
	        	The impact of the rule is expected to be solely to the applications or services deployed within the instance of the technology. As such, an exception or deviation from this rule can be taken by the affected application/service owners.
	        </h:dd>
	        <h:dt>system</h:dt>
	        <h:dd>
	        	The impact of the rule is expected to be on the system level (i.e. the underlying service on which the technology itself is deployed, generally the operating system). As such, an exception or deviation from this rule should be agreed upon by the affected application/service owners and the system responsible.
	        </h:dd>
	        <h:dt>network</h:dt>
	        <h:dd>
	        	The impact of the rule can influence behavior, manageability or security of other services hosted on different systems. Exceptions or deviations from this rule must be granted on the architecture board with security officer advise.
	        </h:dd>
	        <h:dt>organization</h:dt>
	        <h:dd>
	        	The impact of the rule influences one or more business processes, or impacts the manageability or security of various other systems, services or processes. Exceptions or deviations from this rule must be granted on the architecture board with security officer advise. The architecture board might redirect the exception to different decision bodies.
	        </h:dd>
	        <h:dt>group</h:dt>
	        <h:dd>
	        	The impact of the rule impacts multiple business units processes, or results in compliance issues or other severe threats. Exceptions or deviations from this rule must be granted on the appropriate decision body with security officer advise. The architecture board will aide in selecting the right decision body if it has not been determined yet.
	        </h:dd>
	        <h:dt>tbd</h:dt>
	        <h:dd>
	        	The impact of the rule is yet to be determined.
	        </h:dd>
	      </h:dl>
	      <h:p>
	      	Except for the <h:tt>tbd</h:tt> scope, each scope has a <h:tt>-pending</h:tt> as well, meaning that the scope is still a suggestion and pending validation and confirmation by the architecture board.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
	      	Make sure that the roles mentioned are identified. The distinction on scope level is to ensure that not every deviation needs to be processed through decision bodies, while ensuring that sensitive waivers are properly processed.

    			This document is based on an XCCDF resource. To generate a new guide, tooling like <h:em>Open-SCAP</h:em> can be used. In the following three instructions, the document's XML entities (used for repetitive strings and parameters in the document) are replaced, the XCCDF document is validated, and then a guide is generated in HTML format.
