support in the Gentoo Handbook (yes, finally, sorry about that). That
opens up the road for the stabilization of GRUB2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added a dozen fixes to the Gentoo SELinux policy repository and
sent a few others upstream that have been lingering in our policy for
quite some time. But the highlight for me was that I got to play with my
Wacom Bamboo pen and touch which, I must say, integrated easily with my
system. I only had to build the &lt;code&gt;wacom.ko&lt;/code&gt; kernel module and install the
&lt;code&gt;xf86-input-wacom&lt;/code&gt; package, but that's all - no reboot needed. Even GIMP
immediately detected the new device and I can start drawing and fixing
pictures more easily (I work on pictures often and a mouse just isn't
that obvious).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the huge benefits is that the pressure you put on the drawing pad
is related (and configurable) to a drawing function in GIMP, something
you don't have with mice. For instance, if you need to Dodge or Burn on
layers, you don't need to continuously switch between the amount - just
adjust the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category><category term="gimp"></category><category term="tablet"></category><category term="wacom"></category></entry></feed>
