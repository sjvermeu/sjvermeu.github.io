uses Hadoop as the primary platform for several services. As an architect, I
try to get to know the platform's capabilities, its potential use cases, its
surrounding ecosystem, etc. And although the implementation at work is not in
its final form (yay agile infrastructure releases) I do start to get a grasp of
where we might be going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many analysts and architects, this Hadoop platform is a new kid on the block
so I have some work explaining what it is and what it is capable of. Not for the
fun of it, but to help the company make the right decisions, to support management
and operations, to lift the fear of new environments. One thing I've once said is
that "Hadoop is the poor man's mainframe", because I notice some high-level
similarities between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
