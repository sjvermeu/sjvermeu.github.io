also reflects itself on how we (should) look at the processes that are
actively steering infrastructure designs and architecture. One of these
is the business continuity, severe incident handling, and the
hopefully-never-to-occur disaster recovery. When building up procedures
for handling disasters (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery"&gt;DRP = Disaster Recovery Procedure or Disaster 
Recover Planning&lt;/a&gt;),
it is important to keep in mind what these are about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a disaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disasters are major incidents that have wide-ranging consequences to the
regular operations of the business. What entails a disaster can be different
between organizations, although they are commonly tied to the size of the
infrastructure and the organizational and infrastructural maturity. I'll get
back to the size dependency later when covering public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small organization that only has a few systems can declare a
disaster when all those systems are unreachable because their network
provider's line is interrupted. A larger organization probably has
redundancy of the network in place to mitigate that threat. And even
without the redundancy, organizations might just not depend that much
on those services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger the environment becomes though, the more the business depends
on the well-being of the services. And while I can only hope that high
availability, resiliency and appropriate redundancy are taken into account
as well, there are always threats that could jeopardize the availability
of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the problem at hand is specific to one or a manageable set of services,
then taking appropriate action to remediate that threat is generally not a
disaster. It can be a severe incident, but in general it is taken up
by the organization as an incident with a sufficiently small yet
efficient and well organized coordination: the teams involved are 
low in numbers, and the coordination can be done accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the problem is significant or has a very wide scope, then
depending on the standard incident coordination will be insufficient. You
need to coordinate across too many teams, make sure communication is done
correctly, business is continuously involved/consulted, and most of all - 
you want to make sure that the organization doesn't independently try
to resolve issues when they don't have a full view on the situation
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter is a major reason in my opinion why a DRP is so important
to have (the plan/procedure, not an actual disaster). If there is no
proper, well-aligned plan of action, teams will try to get in touch
with other teams, polluting communication and only getting incomplete
information. They might take action that other teams should know about
(but won't) or are heavily impacted by (e.g. because they are at that
time trying to do activities themselves). It can make the situation
much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we have to make a distinction between incident management
and disaster management, an organization has to formally declare
a problem as a disaster, and communicate that singular fact ("we
are now in disaster mode") so that all teams know how to respond: 
according to the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disasters are not just 'force majeure'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disasters aren't extraordinary events or circumstances beyond the
control of the organization. Depending on the business needs, you
might very well take precautionary actions against situations you've
never encountered before and will never encounter. We've recently had
a disastrous weather in Belgium (and other countries in Western Europe)
with floods happening in large areas. But that doesn't mean that
for an organization a flood event will trigger a disaster declaration
within a company (the disastrous weather was a disaster from a
human side, with several dozen deaths and millions of damage, so it
feels somewhat incorrect to consider the threat from a theoretical
standpoint here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're located in a flood-sensitive environment, you can still take
precautionary actions and assess what to do in case of a flood event. 
Depending on the actions taken, a flood event (threat) will not manifest
into availability concerns, data and infrastructure destruction, people
unavailability, etc. It is only when the threat itself turns into an
unforeseen (or non-remediated) situation that we speak of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why disasters depend on organizations, and how risk averse
the organization (and business) is. Some businesses might not want to
take precautionary actions against situations that in the past only
occur once every 100 years, especially if the investment they would
have to do is too significant compared to the losses they might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common disaster threats (sometimes also called catastrophic events)
that I'm used to evaluate from an infrastructure point of view, with a
company that has four strategic data centers, multiple headquarter
locations and a high risk averse setting (considering the financial
market it plays in) are cyberattacks, local but significant infrastructure
disruptions (data center failures or destruction), people-oriented
threats (targetting key personnel), critical provider outages,
disgruntled employees, and so forth. Searching for risk matrices
online can give you some interesting pointers, such as the European
Commission's &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/echo/sites/default/files/swd_2017_176_overview_of_risks_2.pdf"&gt;Overview of Natural and Man-made Disaster Risks the
European Union may
face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public cloud related events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of public cloud, the catastrophic events that might occur are
different, and it would be wrong to just consider the same events and
with the same action plan. A prime example, and the one I really want
people to focus on, is regional outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your current company considers region-wide failures (for
instance because you have two data centers but within the same
region) more from a reactive point of view rather than preventive
(e.g. the DRP in case of region-wide failures is to approach
the reconstruction within the region whenever possible, rather
than fail over to a different region), it might feel the same about
public cloud region failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be wrong though. Whereas it is likely that a region-wide
failure for a company is not going to happen in its lifetime, a public
cloud provider is so much more massive in size, that the likelihood
of region-wide failures is higher. If you do a quick search for
region-wide failures in AWS or Azure, you'll find plenty of examples.
And while the failures themselves might be considered 'incidents' from
the public cloud provider point of view, they might be disasters for
the companies/customers that rely on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, tackling disaster recovery when dealing with public cloud strongly
focuses on region failures and (coordinated) recovery from region failures.
Beyond region failures, I also strongly recommend to look into the dependencies
that the public cloud consumption has with services outside of the public cloud.
Some of these dependencies might also play a role in certain catastrophic
events. Say that you depend on Azure AD for your authentication and
authorization, and Microsoft is suddenly facing not just a world-wide
Azure AD outage, but also has to explain to you that they cannot restore its
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing for disasters is about preparing for multiple possible catastrophic
events, and in case of public cloud, you're required to think at massive scales.
And that includes designing for region-wide failures as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of public cloud disasters to the organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, if your organization has a decent maturity in dealing with disaster
recovery planning, they will be using Service Level Agreements with the
business to help decide what to do in case of disasters. Important
non-functionals that are included here are RTO (Recovery Time Objective), RPO
(Recovery Point Objective), and MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime). There are
others possibly listed in the SLA as well, but let me focus on these three.
If you want to learn more about contigency planning in general, I recommend
to go through the &lt;a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-34r1.pdf"&gt;NIST Special Publication 800-34 Rev.1, "Contingency Planning
Guide for Federal Informatino
Systems"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the RTO, we represent the time it is allowed to take to recover a service
to the point that it functions again. This might include with reduced capacity
or performance degradation. The RTO can be expressed in hours, days, weeks
or other arbitrary value. It is a disaster-oriented value, not availability!
As long as no disaster is declared, the RTO is not considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RPO identifies how much data loss is acceptable by the business in case of
a disaster. Again, this is disaster-oriented: the business can very well take
extra-ordinary steps to ensure full transactional consistency outside of 
disaster situations, yet allow for a "previous day" RPO in case of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MTD is most often declared not on a single service, but at business service
level, and explains how long unavailability of that service is tolerated before
it seriously impacts the survivability of the business. It is related to the
RTO, as most services will have an RTO that is more strict/lower value than the
overall MTD, whereas the MTD is near non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what does public cloud disasters have to do with this? Well, in theory
nothing, as this model and process of capturing business requirements is quite
sensible and maps out perfectly as well. However (and here's the culprit),
an organization that sets up new services on a frequent basis might get
accustomed to certain values, and these values might not be as easy to approach
in a public cloud environment. Furthermore, the organization might not be
accustomed to different disaster scenario's for the SLA: having different sets
of RTO/RPO depending on the category of disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get back to the region-wide disasters. A company might have decided not
to have region-wide proactive measures in place, and fixate their SLA
non-functionals on local disasters: a data center failure is considered a threat
that still requires proactive measures, whereas regional failures are treated
differently.  The organization decides to only have one SLA set defined, and
includes RTO and RPO values based on the current, local threat matrix. They
might decide that a majority of applications or services has a RPO of "last
transaction", meaning the data has to be fully restored at the latest situation
in case of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This generally implies synchronous replication as an infrastructural
solution. If the organization is used to having this method available (for
instance through SAN replication, cluster technologies, database recovery,
etc.) then they won't sweat at all if the next dozen services all require
the same RPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now comes the public cloud, and a strong point of attention is region-wide
failures. Doing synchronous replication across regions is not a proper tactic
(as it implies significant performance degradation) and especially not sensible
to do at the same scale as with local replication (e.g. between availability
zones in the same region). Now you have to tell your business that this RPO
value is not easily attainable in the public cloud. The public cloud, which
solves all the wonders in the world. The public cloud, which has more maturity
on operations than your own company. Yet you can't deliver the same SLA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apples and pears. The disasters are different, so your offering might be
different. Of course, you should explain that your 'on premise' disaster
scenarios do not include region-wide failures, and that if you include
the same scenarios for 'on premise' that that RPO value would not be
attainable on premise either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public cloud provides many capabilities, and has to deal with a
significantly larger environment than companies are used to. This also means
that disasters that are considered 'extremely unlikely' are now 'likely' (given
the massive scale of the public cloud), and that the threats you have to
consider while dealing with disaster recovery have to be re-visited for public
cloud enabled scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is to tackle the disaster-oriented non-functional requirements
by categorizing the disasters and having different requirements based on the
disaster at hand. Mature your cloud endeavours so that regional outages
are not a problem anymore (moving them away from the 'disaster' board), and 
properly map all dependencies you have through the public cloud exercises so
that you can build up a good view on what possible threats exist that would
require a well-coordinated approach to tackle the event.&lt;/p&gt;

stakeholders that have no common understanding of what infrastructure means in
an enterprise architecture. Since then, I am trying to figure out a way to
easily explain it - to find a common, generic view on what infrastructure
entails. If successful, I could use this common view to provide context on the
many, many IT projects that are going around.&lt;/p&gt;

I try to keep track of the architecture and designs of the IT services and
solutions in a way that I feel helps me keep in touch with all the various
services and solutions out there. Similar to how system administrators try to
find a balance while working on documentation (which is often considered a
chore) and using a structure that is sufficiently simple and standard for the
organization to benefit from, architects should try to keep track of
architecturally relevant information as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this post, I'm going to explain a bit more on how I approach documenting
service and solution insights for architectural relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications&lt;/em&gt;. It provides a
domain-specific language to describe how an application should be deployed
in the cloud (the topology), which and how many resources it needs, as well
as tasks to run when certain events occur (the orchestration). When I
initially came across this standard, I was (and still am) interested
in how far this goes. The promise of declaring an application (and even
bundling the necessary application artefacts) within a single asset and
then using this asset to deploy on whatever cloud is very appealing to
an architect. Especially in organizations that have a multi-cloud
strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

capabilities into an organization’s portfolio. Smaller SaaS solutions are
simple, web-based solutions which barely integrate with the organization’s
other solutions, besides the identity and access management (which is often
handled by federated authentication).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More complex or intermediate solutions require more integration focus, and
a whole new market of Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) solutions
came up to facilitate cross-cloud integrations. But even without the iPaaS
offerings, integrations are often a mandatory part to leverage the benefits
of the newly activated SaaS solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I want to bring some thoughts on the integrations that might be
needed to support customizing a SaaS solution.&lt;/p&gt;

of the enterprise architects teams. The domain I am accountable for is 
“infrastructure”, which can be seen as a very broad one. Now, I’ve been
maintaining an overview of our IT services before I reached that role, 
mainly from an elaborate interest in the subject, as well as to optimize
my efficiency further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a domain architect allows me to use the insights I’ve since
gathered to try and give appropriate advice, but also now requires me to
maintain a domain architecture. This structure is going to be the starting
point of it, although it is not the true all and end all of what I would
consider a domain architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

infrastructure, infrastructure architects will attempt to make itless
complex and chaotic by introducing and maintaining a certain degree of
standardization. While many might consider standardization as a
rationalization (standardizing on a single database technology, single
vendor for hardware, etc.), rationalization is only one of the many ways
in which standards can simplify such a degree of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'd like to point out two other, very common ways to
standardize the IT environment, without really considering a
rationalization: abstraction and virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;

Some even consider it to be more magic than reality. And with
the ongoing evolutions and inventions, the complexity is not really going
away. Sure, some IT areas are becoming easier to understand, but that is often
offset with new areas being explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies and organizations that have a sizeable IT footprint generally see an
increase in their infrastructure, regardless of how many rationalization
initiatives that are started. Personally, I find it challenging, in a fun
way, to keep up with the onslaught of new technologies and services that are
onboarded in the infrastructure landscape that I'm responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just understanding a technology isn't enough to deal with its position in
the larger environment.&lt;/p&gt;

With my day job becoming more intensive and my side-job taking the remainder

of releasing a new edition of the SELinux System Administration book, so I'll
probably discuss that more later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to write about a task I had to do this year as brand new domain
architect for infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sven Vermeulen</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 13:20:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.siphos.be,2020-10-04:/2020/10/working-on-infra-strategy/</guid><category>Architecture</category></item><item><title>Project prioritization</title><link>https://blog.siphos.be/2017/07/project-prioritization/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;This is a long read, skip to “Prioritizing the projects and changes” for the
approach details...&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations and companies generally have an IT workload (dare I say,
backlog?) which needs to be properly assessed, prioritized and taken up.
Sometimes, the IT team(s) get an amount of budget and HR resources to "do their
thing", while others need to continuously ask for approval to launch a new
project or instantiate a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sizeable organizations even require engineering and development effort on IT
projects which are not readily available: specialized teams exist, but they are
governance-wise assigned to projects. And as everyone thinks their project is
the top-most priority one, many will be disappointed when they hear there are
no resources available for their pet project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... how should organizations prioritize such projects?&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sven Vermeulen</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 20:40:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.siphos.be,2017-07-18:/2017/07/project-prioritization/</guid><category>Architecture</category><category>pmo</category><category>strategy</category><category>SAFe</category><category>prioritization</category><category>project</category></item><item><title>Structuring infrastructural deployments</title><link>https://blog.siphos.be/2017/06/structuring-infrastructural-deployments/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Many organizations struggle with the all-time increase in IP address
allocation and the accompanying need for segmentation. In the past, governing
the segments within the organization means keeping close control over the
service deployments, firewall rules, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, the idea of micro-segmentation, supported through software-defined
networking solutions, seems to defy the need for a segmentation governance.
However, I think that that is a very short-sighted sales proposition. Even
with micro-segmentation, or even pure point-to-point / peer2peer communication
flow control, you'll still be needing a high level overview of the services
within your scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I'll give some insights in how we are approaching this in
the company I work for. In short, it starts with requirements gathering,
creating labels to assign to deployments, creating groups based on one or two
labels in a layered approach, and finally fixating the resulting schema and
start mapping guidance documents (policies) toward the presented architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

a couple of technological domains, namely databases and scheduling/workload 
automation. It brought me in contact with many vendors, many technologies
and most importantly, many teams within the organization. The focus domain
was challenging, as I had to deal with the strategy on how the organization,
which is a financial institution, will deal with databases and scheduling in
the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://coreos.com/blog/rocket/"&gt;Rocket&lt;/a&gt; and the like get (I recommend to look at 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/p8952/bocker"&gt;Bocker&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Wilmott as well ;-), I
still find it important that technologies are well capable of supporting a
multi-instance environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to run multiple instances makes for great consolidation. The system
can be optimized for the technology, access to the system limited to the admins
of said technology while still providing isolation between instances. For some
technologies, running on commodity hardware just doesn't cut it (not all
