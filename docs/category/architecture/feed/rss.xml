of the enterprise architects teams. The domain I am accountable for is 
“infrastructure”, which can be seen as a very broad one. Now, I’ve been
maintaining an overview of our IT services before I reached that role, 
mainly from an elaborate interest in the subject, as well as to optimize
my efficiency further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a domain architect allows me to use the insights I’ve since
gathered to try and give appropriate advice, but also now requires me to
maintain a domain architecture. This structure is going to be the starting
point of it, although it is not the true all and end all of what I would
consider a domain architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single picture doesn’t say it all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off with my overview, I had a need to structure the hundreds of
technology services that I want to keep an eye on in a way that I can 
quickly find it back, as well as present to other stakeholders what 
infrastructure services are about. This structure, while not perfect, 
currently looks like in the figure below. Occasionally, I move one or
more service groups left or right, but the main intention is just to
have a structure available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Overview of the IT services" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/202106/it_service_overview.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figures like these often come about in mapping exercises, or capability models.
A capability model that I recently skimmed through is the
&lt;a href="https://www.if4it.com/SYNTHESIZED/MODELS/ENTERPRISE/enterprise_capability_model.html"&gt;IF4IT Enterprise Capability Model&lt;/a&gt;.
I stumbled upon this model after searching for some reference architectures
on approaching IT services, including a paper titled
&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238620971_IT_Services_Reference_Catalog"&gt;IT Services Reference Catalog&lt;/a&gt;
by Nelson Gama, Maria do Mar Rosa, and Miguel Mira da Silva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capability models, or service overviews like the one I presented, do not fit
each and every organization well. When comparing the view I maintain with
others (or the different capability and service references out there), I
notice two main distinctions: grouping, and granularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain capabilities might be grouped one way in one reference, and use a
  totally different grouping in another. A database system might be part of
  a “Databases” group in one, a “Data Management” group in another, or even
  “Information Management” in a third. Often, this grouping also reveals the
  granularity that the author wants to pursue.&lt;br/&gt;
  Grouping allows for keeping things organized and easier to explain, but has
  no structural importance. Of course, a well-chosen grouping also allows you
  to tie principles and other architectural concerts to the groups themselves,
  and not services in particular. But that still falls under the explainability
  part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The granularity is more about how specific a grouping is. In the example
  above, “Information Management” is the most coarse-grained grouping, whereas
  “Databases” might be a very specific one. Granularity can convey more insights
  in the importance of services, although it can also be due to historical
  reasons, or because an overview started from one specific service and expanded
  later. In that case, it is very likely that the specific service and its
  dependencies are more elaborately documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure I maintain, the grouping is often based both on the extensiveness 
of a group (if a group contains far too many services, I might want to see if I
can split up the group) as well as historical and organizational choices. For
instance, if the organization has a clear split between network oriented
teams and server oriented teams, then the overview will most likely convey
the same message, as we want to have the overview interpretable by many
stakeholders - and those stakeholders are often aware of the organizational
distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services versus solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to keep track of the evolutions of &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solutions&lt;/em&gt; within this
overview. Now, the definition of a “service” versus “solution” does warrant
a bit more explanation, as it can have multiple meanings. I even use “service”
for different purposes depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For domain architecture, I consider an “&lt;em&gt;infrastructure service&lt;/em&gt;” as a product
that realizes or supports an IT capability. It is strongly product oriented
(even when it is internally developed, or a cloud service, or an appliance)
and makes a distinction between products that are often very closely related.
For instance, Oracle DB is an infrastructure service, as is the Oracle
Enterprise Manager. The Oracle DB is a product that realizes a “relational
database” capability, whereas OEM is a “central infrastructure management”
capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I create distinct notes for these is because they have different
life cycles, might have different organizational responsible teams, different
setups, etc. Hence, components (parts of products) I generally do not consider
as separate, although there are definitely examples where it makes sense to
consider certain components separate from the products in which they are
provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The several hundred infrastructure services that the company is rich in are
all documented under this overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside these infrastructure services I also maintain a solution overview.
The grouping is exactly the same as the infrastructure services, but the
intention of solutions is more from a full internal offering point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within &lt;em&gt;solution architectures&lt;/em&gt;, I tend to focus on the choices that the
company made and the design that follows it. Many solutions are considered
‘platforms’ on top of which internal development, third party hosting or
other capabilities are provided. Within the solution, I describe how the
various infrastructure services interact and work together to make the
solution reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example here is the mainframe platform. Whereas the mainframe itself
is definitely an infrastructure service, how we internally organize the
workload and the runtimes (such as the LPARs), how it integrates with the
security services, database services, enterprise job scheduling, etc. is
documented in the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all my domain though&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all services and solutions that I track are part of ‘my’ domain though.
For instance, at my company, we make a distinction between the
infrastructure-that-is-mostly-hosting, and
infrastructure-that-is-mostly-workplace. My focus is on the ‘mostly hosting’
orientation, whereas I have a colleague domain architect responsible for
the ‘mostly workplace’ side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s just about accountability. Not knowing how the other solutions
and services function, how they are set up, etc. would make my job harder,
so tracking their progress and architecture is effort that pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a later post I’ll explain what I document about services and solutions
and how I do it when I have some time to spend.&lt;/p&gt;

infrastructure, infrastructure architects will attempt to make itless
complex and chaotic by introducing and maintaining a certain degree of
standardization. While many might consider standardization as a
rationalization (standardizing on a single database technology, single
vendor for hardware, etc.), rationalization is only one of the many ways
in which standards can simplify such a degree of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'd like to point out two other, very common ways to
standardize the IT environment, without really considering a
rationalization: abstraction and virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;

Some even consider it to be more magic than reality. And with
the ongoing evolutions and inventions, the complexity is not really going
away. Sure, some IT areas are becoming easier to understand, but that is often
offset with new areas being explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies and organizations that have a sizeable IT footprint generally see an
increase in their infrastructure, regardless of how many rationalization
initiatives that are started. Personally, I find it challenging, in a fun
way, to keep up with the onslaught of new technologies and services that are
onboarded in the infrastructure landscape that I'm responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just understanding a technology isn't enough to deal with its position in
the larger environment.&lt;/p&gt;

With my day job becoming more intensive and my side-job taking the remainder
of the time, I've since quit my work on the Gentoo project. I am in process
of releasing a new edition of the SELinux System Administration book, so I'll
probably discuss that more later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to write about a task I had to do this year as brand new domain
architect for infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sven Vermeulen</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 13:20:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.siphos.be,2020-10-04:/2020/10/working-on-infra-strategy/</guid><category>Architecture</category></item><item><title>Project prioritization</title><link>https://blog.siphos.be/2017/07/project-prioritization/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;This is a long read, skip to “Prioritizing the projects and changes” for the
approach details...&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations and companies generally have an IT workload (dare I say,
backlog?) which needs to be properly assessed, prioritized and taken up.
Sometimes, the IT team(s) get an amount of budget and HR resources to "do their
thing", while others need to continuously ask for approval to launch a new
project or instantiate a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sizeable organizations even require engineering and development effort on IT
projects which are not readily available: specialized teams exist, but they are
governance-wise assigned to projects. And as everyone thinks their project is
the top-most priority one, many will be disappointed when they hear there are
no resources available for their pet project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... how should organizations prioritize such projects?&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sven Vermeulen</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 20:40:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.siphos.be,2017-07-18:/2017/07/project-prioritization/</guid><category>Architecture</category><category>pmo</category><category>strategy</category><category>SAFe</category><category>prioritization</category><category>project</category></item><item><title>Structuring infrastructural deployments</title><link>https://blog.siphos.be/2017/06/structuring-infrastructural-deployments/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Many organizations struggle with the all-time increase in IP address
allocation and the accompanying need for segmentation. In the past, governing
the segments within the organization means keeping close control over the
service deployments, firewall rules, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, the idea of micro-segmentation, supported through software-defined
networking solutions, seems to defy the need for a segmentation governance.
However, I think that that is a very short-sighted sales proposition. Even
with micro-segmentation, or even pure point-to-point / peer2peer communication
flow control, you'll still be needing a high level overview of the services
within your scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I'll give some insights in how we are approaching this in
the company I work for. In short, it starts with requirements gathering,
creating labels to assign to deployments, creating groups based on one or two
labels in a layered approach, and finally fixating the resulting schema and
start mapping guidance documents (policies) toward the presented architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

a couple of technological domains, namely databases and scheduling/workload 
automation. It brought me in contact with many vendors, many technologies
and most importantly, many teams within the organization. The focus domain
was challenging, as I had to deal with the strategy on how the organization,
which is a financial institution, will deal with databases and scheduling in
the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://coreos.com/blog/rocket/"&gt;Rocket&lt;/a&gt; and the like get (I recommend to look at 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/p8952/bocker"&gt;Bocker&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Wilmott as well ;-), I
still find it important that technologies are well capable of supporting a
multi-instance environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to run multiple instances makes for great consolidation. The system
can be optimized for the technology, access to the system limited to the admins
of said technology while still providing isolation between instances. For some
technologies, running on commodity hardware just doesn't cut it (not all 
software is written for such hardware platforms) and consolidation allows for
reducing (hardware/licensing) costs.&lt;/p&gt;
