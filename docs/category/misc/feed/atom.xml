OSI network model as a way to describe the difficulties of discussions or
cases. These three additional layers are Financial Layer, Politics Layer
and Religion Layer, and the idea is that the higher up you go, the more
challenging discussions will be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recap on the OSI model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model for
network-oriented communications, which has 7 layers - each with their own
specific peculiarities and service offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven layers are, from top to bottom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Application Layer which provide the high-level interfaces to the
   application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Presentation Layer which maps data as seen / used by an application
   to the network &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Session Layer which enables continuous / conversational communication
   between nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Transport Layer which looks at reliable transmissions between systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Network Layer which handles functions like addressing and routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Data Link Layer which looks at the interchange of frames (collection of
   bits and the interpretation of it) between two systems that are connected by
   a physical medium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Physical Layer which looks at how bits are sent over the physical medium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many network protocols can be mapped to one or more of these layers. The WiFi
standards focus on the physical and data link layers, while the IP standard
is network layer oriented. The TCP standard is strongly session and transport
layers oriented. The HTTP standard has a strong focus on the application and
presentation layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the OSI model isn’t 100% applied in standards and protocols, it is
conceptually a very common way of looking at communications and network
stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSI layers as complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I jokingly refer to the OSI model for complexity and difficulties of
discussions, it is through the assumption that the challenges rise the higher
up in the stack you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The increasing complexity of discussions" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/202106/OSI_extended.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions related to the physical aspects are often the easiest: they are about
tangible objects, people understand or at least properly observe the physical
aspects. There is little misinterpretation of the information presented to the
discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we start rising up the stack. Discussions that are close to the physical
aspects are still easy to moderate, but the higher up we go the more chance we
have of misinterpretation of the information at hand. People make more
assumptions to understand the discussion, which might lead to misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher layers are also because we want to abstract away the complexity of
reality. Discussions are held on topics that have wider consequences, and thus we
abstract this complexity in models so that the discussions can move forward
quickly enough. If not all people understand the abstraction (and its
consequences), the discussions might quickly move to details and specifics that
do not provide much value to the discussion, but are considered as necessary by
some of the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, the higher up we go, the more flexibility organizations expect. On
the lowest level we often have few and highly standardized choices, whereas on
higher levels we have different standards due to business units with other
requirements. The complexity rises tremendously, and we are often challenged by
stakeholders with different agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSI model’s highest layer is the application layer, which is the layer that
covers discussions on (business) applications, which is often the level of
discussions systems architects often have to deal with. A business unit wants
solution X, but that solution isn’t compatible with the standards and enablers
that the organization already has in place. Another business unit also wants
solution X, but in a different way. And while we have solution Y in place as
well that covers 80% of the functionality… Well, you know where this is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there are situations even worse, which make discussions and the attempts
to find a consensus even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Financial Layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one (layer 8 so to speak) is the Financial Layer. Here the
discussions are on the economic side of things, and if you think those are
the easier discussions out there (because financials are mathematically
sound, right?) I urge you to dive deeper into this subject, because
there is plenty of work out there to simplify these discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only commonality I see with financial or economical discussions
is that they use a currency as a unit together with a time indication.
But that’s about it. Even the value of (or interpretation on) the
currency isn’t set in stone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies for instance often use internal charging for service usages.
This charging isn’t a cost that the company spends, it is mostly just
to attribute things to one business unit or the other. You might say it
is monopoly (the game) money. But that’s not always the case, as internal
charging in larger companies might also effectively reflect themselves in
the books / ledgers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you are charged - regardless if it is monopoly money or not - you
tend to really try to get the best deal… even though we are talking about
chargeback and thus not actual “profits and loss” of the company. If you
force your charging to be lower, you’re forcing other’s charging to get
higher. And they don’t like that, but rather than discussing this amongst
themselves, the discussions are often pointed towards the owner of the
service and its chargeback method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or when project leaders make a business case (to show if a project is
beneficial from the financial side for the company) using chargeback
information. Chargeback doesn’t always (and in my opinion, mostly never)
reflect the true costs of a service, so using chargeback-currency for a
profit &amp;amp; loss currency is a big no-no. Yet this is oh so common still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when we have the right mindset and focus on actual costs… Well,
they are hard to obtain, because actual costs are complex beasts. You’ll
find plenty of resources online about the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO),
but none of them are truly the right resource to never look at others.
TCOs are hard, you need to consider things you don’t even knew you have
to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or when you want to know just how something incurs on license costs.
Well, good luck in understanding how the vendor measures it (looking
at you, Oracle and Microsoft), or what deals your company has made with
the vendors under the umbrella of “enterprise agreements” which make all
the online resources you find useless. I had the role of license manager
for all our Oracle products for a few years, and was involved with the
Microsoft license management within my company, and it took me a while
to streamline it and communicate it properly within the organization
so all stakeholders were sufficiently aware of what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Politics Layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But financial discussions are peanuts compared with discussions that
reflect internal politics. I’m explicitly not calling this layer
strategy, although most of the discussions related to a companies’
strategy (or the strategy of the business units) are situated here
as well. It is also not governmental politics here, but the internal
domains where internal politics are reflected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the discussions where you, as an architect or engineer,
come in with a presentation that covers all the ends, handles the
financial side correctly and with agreements from other architects
or engineers that the figures are sound, the solution alternatives
correctly evaluated, and the preferred solution a good balance of
all the requirements… only to find that the temperature in the room
says otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions on the politics layer cover everything except what is
truly at the heart of what the discussion is about. They are about
hidden agendas that you will not be presented with at the meeting.
Many senior profiles (or, perhaps better, expert profiles) in an
organization tend to know what these hidden agendas are about, and
know how to ‘play’ and use these politics further. While their
seniority of course also focuses on the efficiency side (for instance,
a senior project leader can tackle larger projects, structure projects
better, are fluent in reporting, etc.) it is truly their organizational
experience (and sometimes ‘reading people’ skills) that makes them
quickly grow in their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to obtain the hidden agendas and work on disentangling
the complexity of it. Hidden agendas are often based on wrong assumptions,
past emotional stress, or missing information. While you often cannot
try to attack these agendas head-first, understanding their nature can
often help in presenting cases in a way that facilitates the discussions.
You can disarm the emotional stress, or start with tackling the assumptions
that might float around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Religion Layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, even seasoned expert profiles however come across discussions that
are not just about internal politics or people’s hidden agendas. Sometimes
discussions just take on a religious nature. This is when people are adamant
that something is true, regardless of the facts or other material that you
bring in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious discussion can be found all over the place, not just on management
level. They can be about tooling, operating systems, designs, hosting choices,
etc. You all know there are people who can discuss Linux versus Windows for
ages and ages. Discussions on cloud versus on premise also often are religious
in nature. And the less time the organization allows for finding facts and
figures, the more these kinds of discussions pop up, and nobody wins on these
in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing when a discussion is internal politics (and thus can still be tackled)
versus religion is hard. But once I know a discussion is no longer going to be
settled with facts, figures, and emotional/psychological approaches, then I
will be likely to try and evade those meetings. I’ll try to facilitate a
management decision (if it isn’t religious on management level either) or
just deal with the onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges that are to be settled on the religion layer are no longer about
finding the optimal solution, but finding a solution or decision that is
“not in the wrong direction”. And while this is a much lower bar, it is hard
enough to reach it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="OSI"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="humor"></category></entry><entry><title>Switched to Lineage OS</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2017/04/switched-to-lineage-os/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-09T16:40:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-04-09T16:40:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2017-04-09:/2017/04/switched-to-lineage-os/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been a long time user of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod"&gt;Cyanogenmod&lt;/a&gt;,

to review other ROMs for my Samsung Galaxy SIII (the i9300 model) phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I made my choice and installed LineageOS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The requirements list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking for new ROMs to use, I had a number of requirements, some must-have, others
should-have or would-have (using the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method"&gt;MoSCoW method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I want the ROM to be installable through ClockworkMod 6.4.0.something. This
is a mandatory requirement, because I don't want to venture out in installing a different
recovery (like &lt;a href="https://twrp.me/"&gt;TWRP&lt;/a&gt;). Not that much that I'm scared from it, but it might
require me to install stuff like Heimdal and update my SELinux policies on my system to allow
it to run, and has the additional risk that things still fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried updating the recovery ROM in the past (a year or so ago) using the mobile application
approaches themselves (which require root access, that my phone had at the time) but it continuously
said that it failed and that I had to revert to the more traditional way of flashing the
recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I know I need to upgrade within a day (and have other things planned today) I didn't
want to loose too much time in upgrading the recovery first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the ROM had to allow OTA updates. With CyanogenMod, the OTA didn't fully work on
my phone (it downloaded and verified the images correctly, but couldn't install it
automatically - I had to reboot in recovery manually and install the ZIP), but it worked
sufficiently for me to easily update the phone on a weekly basis. I wanted to keep this luxury,
and who knows, move towards an end-to-end working OTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the ROM had to support Android 7.1. I want the latest Android to see how long
this (nowadays aged) phone can handle things. Once the phone cannot get the latest Android
anymore, I'll probably move towards a new phone. But as long as I don't have to, I'll put
my money in other endeavours ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the ROM must be in active development. One of the reasons I want the latest Android
is also because I want to keep receiving the necessary security fixes. If a ROM doesn't
actively follow the security patches and code, then it might become (too) vulnerable for
comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROMs, ROMs everywhere (?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I visited the &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3/development"&gt;Galaxy S3 discussion&lt;/a&gt;
on the XDA-Developers site. This often contains enough material to find ROMs which have 
a somewhat active development base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still positively surprised by the activity on this quite old phone (the i9300 was
first released in May, 2012, making this phone almost 5 years old).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3/development/vanir-aosp-t3568393"&gt;Vanir&lt;/a&gt;
mod seemed to imply that TWRP was required, but past articles on Vanir showed that CWM
should also work. However, from the discussion I gathered that it is based on LineageOS.
Not that that's bad, but it makes LineageOS the "preferred" ROM first (default installed
software list, larger upstream community, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://forum.resurrectionremix.com/"&gt;Ressurrection Remix&lt;/a&gt;
shows a very active discussion with good feedback from the developer(s). It is based on
a number of other resources (including CyanogenMod), so seems to borrow and implement
various other features. Although I got the slight impression that it would be a bit more
filled with applications I might not want, I kept it on the short-list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s3/development/slimrom-t3580824"&gt;SLIMROM&lt;/a&gt; is
based on AOSP (the Android Open Source Project). It doesn't seem to support OTA though,
and its release history is currently still premature. However, I will keep an eye on this
one for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, I started looking for ROMs based on AOSP, as the majority of ROMs shown
are based on LineageOS (abbreviated to LOS). Apparently, for the Samsung S3, LineageOS
seems to be one of the most popular sources (and ROMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I put my attention to LineageOS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;a href="https://lineageosrom.org/install-lineageos-cwm/"&gt;supports CWM installations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It offers OTA update support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It closely tracks upstream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is in active development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using LineageOS without root&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While deciding to use LineageOS or go through with additional ROM seeking, I stumbled
upon the installation instructions that showed that the ROM can be installed without
automatically enabling rooted Android access. I'm not sure if this was the case with
Cyanogenmod (I've been running with a rooted Cyanogenmod for too long to remember) but
it opened a possiblity for me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don't mind having a rooted phone, as long as it is the user who decides
which applications can get root access and which can't. For me, the two applications
that used root access was an open source ad blocker called &lt;a href="https://adaway.org/"&gt;AdAway&lt;/a&gt;
and the Android shell (for troubleshooting purposes, such as killing the media server
if it locked my camera).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some applications seem to think that a rooted phone automatically means that the
phone is open access and full of malware. It is hard to find any trustworthy, academical
research on the actual secure state of rooted versus non-rooted devices. I believe 
that proper application vetting (don't install applications that aren't popular
and long-existing, check the application vendors, etc.) and keeping your phone up-to-date
is much more important than not rooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although these applications happily function on old, unpatched Android 4.x devices
they refuse to function on my (rooted) Android 7.1 phone. So, the ability to install
LineageOS without root (rooting actually requires flashing an additional package) is
a nice thing as I can start with a non-rooted device first, and switch back to a rooted
device if I need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I decided to flash my phone with the latest LineageOS nightly for my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching password manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to use such ROM switches (or, in case of CyanogenMod, major version upgrades)
as a time to revisit the mobile application list, and reduce it to what I really used
the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the changes I did on my mobile application list is switch the password application.
I used to use &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ebeletskiy.gmail.com.passwords"&gt;Remember Passwords&lt;/a&gt;
but it hasn't seen updates for quite some time, and the backup import failed last
time I migrated to a higher CyanogenMod version (possibly Android version related).
Because I don't want to synchronize the passwords or see the application have any Internet
oriented activity, I now use &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android_nonet"&gt;Keepass2Android Offline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is for passwords which I don't auto-generate using &lt;a href="https://chriszarate.github.io/supergenpass/"&gt;SuperGenPass&lt;/a&gt;,
my favorite password manager. I don't use the bookmarklet approach myself, but download
and run it separately when generating passwords - or use a &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.staticfree.SuperGenPass&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;SuperGenPass mobile application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is too soon to say if it is fully functional or not. Most standard functionality
works OK (phone, SMS, camera) but it is only after a few days that specific issues
can come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the first boot was very slow (probably because it was optimizing the application
list in the background), the second boot was well below half a minute. I didn't count it,
but it's fast enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="cyanogenmod"></category><category term="lineageos"></category><category term="mobile"></category><category term="android"></category></entry><entry><title>I missed FOSDEM</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2017/02/i-missed-fosdem/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-07T17:06:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-02-07T17:06:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2017-02-07:/2017/02/i-missed-fosdem/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I sadly had to miss out on the FOSDEM event.

a lower activity within the free software communities that I'm active
in. Still, I'm not planning any exit, on the contrary. Lots of ideas are
just waiting for some free time to engage. So what are the challenges
that have been taking up my time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them is that I recently moved. And with moving comes a lot of
work in getting the place into a good shape and getting settled. Today I
finished the last job that I wanted to finish in my appartment in a
short amount of time, so that's one thing off my TODO list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one is that I started an intensive master-after-master programme
with the subject of &lt;em&gt;Enterprise Architecture&lt;/em&gt;. This not only takes up
quite some ex-cathedra time, but also additional hours of studying (and
for the moment also exams). But I'm really satisfied that I can take up
this course, as I've been wandering around in the world of enterprise
architecture for some time now and want to grow even further in this
field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not all. One of my side activities has been blooming a lot,
and I recently reached the 200th server that I'm administering (although
I think this number will reduce to about 120 as I'm helping one
organization with handing over management of their 80+ systems to their
own IT staff). Together with some friends (who also have non-profit
customers' IT infrastructure management as their side-business) we're
now looking at consolidating our approach to system administration (and
engineering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also looking at investing time and resources in a start-up,
depending on the business plan and required efforts. But more
information on this later when things are more clear :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Umounting IPv6 NFS(v4) mounts</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/08/umounting-ipv6-nfsv4-mounts/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-23T13:46:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-23T13:46:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-08-23:/2013/08/umounting-ipv6-nfsv4-mounts/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had issues umounting my NFSv4 shares on an IPv6-only network.

&lt;p&gt;I also added a dozen fixes to the Gentoo SELinux policy repository and
sent a few others upstream that have been lingering in our policy for
quite some time. But the highlight for me was that I got to play with my
Wacom Bamboo pen and touch which, I must say, integrated easily with my
system. I only had to build the &lt;code&gt;wacom.ko&lt;/code&gt; kernel module and install the
&lt;code&gt;xf86-input-wacom&lt;/code&gt; package, but that's all - no reboot needed. Even GIMP
immediately detected the new device and I can start drawing and fixing
pictures more easily (I work on pictures often and a mouse just isn't
that obvious).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the huge benefits is that the pressure you put on the drawing pad
is related (and configurable) to a drawing function in GIMP, something
you don't have with mice. For instance, if you need to Dodge or Burn on
layers, you don't need to continuously switch between the amount - just
adjust the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="gimp"></category><category term="tablet"></category><category term="wacom"></category></entry><entry><title>Hacking java bytecode with dhex</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/06/hacking-java-bytecode-with-dhex/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-01T03:50:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-06-01T03:50:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-06-01:/2013/06/hacking-java-bytecode-with-dhex/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found myself in a weird situation: a long long time ago, I wrote a

java application that I didn't touch nor ran for a few years. Today, I
found it on a backup and wanted to run it again (its a graphical
application for generating HTML pages). However, it failed in a
particular feature. Not with an exception or stack trace, just
functionally. Now, I have the source code at hand, so I look into the
code and find the logical error. Below is a snippet of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;if (myHandler != null) {
  int i = startValue + maxRange;
  for (int j = endValue; j &amp;gt; i; j--) {
    ... (do some logic)
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter what the code is supposed to do, but from what I can
remember, I shouldn't be adding &lt;code&gt;maxRange&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; variable (yet - as
I do that later in the code). But instead of setting up the java
development environment, emerging the IDE etc. I decided to just edit
the class file directly using &lt;strong&gt;dhex&lt;/strong&gt; (a wonderful utility I recently
discovered) because doing things the hard way is sometimes fun as well.
So I ran &lt;strong&gt;javap -c MyClass&lt;/strong&gt; to get some java bytecode information from
the method, which gives me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   8:   ifnull  116
   11:  iload_2
   12:  iload_3
   13:  iadd
   14:  istore  5
   16:  iload_2
   17:  istore  6
   19:  iload   6
   21:  iload   5
   23:  if_icmpge       106
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know lines 11 and 12 is about pushing the 2nd and 3rd arguments of the
function (which are &lt;code&gt;startValue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maxRange&lt;/code&gt;) to the stack to add
them (line 13). To remove the third argument, I can change this opcode
from &lt;code&gt;1d&lt;/code&gt; (iload_3) to &lt;code&gt;03&lt;/code&gt; (iconst_0). This way, zero is added and
the code itself just continues as needed. And for some reason, that
seems to be the only mistake I made then because the application now
works flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacking is fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="bytecode"></category><category term="dhex"></category><category term="java"></category></entry><entry><title>Centers of Excellence</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2011/10/centers-of-excellence/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-25T20:12:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-10-25T20:12:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2011-10-25:/2011/10/centers-of-excellence/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When dealing with software (I'll talk about software here, but the

information is applicable to most technologies, such as appliances and
operating systems) many organizations want to have "centers of
excellence" with respect to the software. These teams are responsible
for positioning the software within the organization, supporting the
software and if necessary, act as a link between the internal customer
and the software vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach on these "centers of excellence" is often described as a
cost efficient way of handling the software within the organization.
Sadly, many organizations go to the extreme and try to put as much
support and services within those teams as possible, hoping that full
consolidation of all service matters would yield an even better
(financial) benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such further consolidation however has a negative side which is often
overlooked: &lt;em&gt;centralized teams are less aware of the internal customers'
requirements and situation&lt;/em&gt;. Most internal customers probably have their
own IT teams that are much better informed about the criticality of the
customers' systems and the services that the customer requests. Those
teams are then responsible for getting the right services from those
"centers of excellence". And that is where the difficulty lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Centers of excellence" are &lt;em&gt;based on products and technical services&lt;/em&gt;.
They want to provide the best-in-class service with their products and
as such keep enhancing their services in the hope that they can serve
all internal customers. But by doing so, they are becoming more and more
of a product vendor. In the end, they either focus on the product
completely, or they focus on some frameworks and tooling that they have
designed and developed to support the integration of the product within
the organization. For the IT teams of the internal customer however, the
"centers of excellence" are less seen as part of the organization and
more as a vendor (or broker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean that the concept of these "centers of excellence" is
wrong though, but they need to keep the organization itself in mind when
dealing with the product. The detail on services that they offer need to
be aligned with the organizations' strategy and weighted to provide a
cost efficient, yet qualitatively best-in-class service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all that is easier said than done. So let me suggest an
approach on software service(s) within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest service that the organization must support for any software
is &lt;strong&gt;assistance in the installation, upgrade, tracking and eventual
removal of the software&lt;/strong&gt;. Such a service is always needed and can be
provided with little knowledge of the internal customer. A "center of
excellence" should provide the means to (semi)automatically install the
software - preferably using the organizations' standard software
deployment methods, upgrade the software (both for major releases, minor
releases as well as security patches), remove and (not to forget) track
where the software is installed. Especially when dealing with
proprietary software, tracking is almost mandatory for organizations to
keep track of the licenses needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lowest service offering has almost only positive sides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT teams that need the software can easily (and without further
    assistance of other teams) install the software. If the installation
    method is automated, it can even be done in a fast manner, which is
    always to the liking of the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The organization keeps its risks low by providing the security
    updates and product upgrades in a seem less manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By tracking deployments, the organization can keep track of licenses
    used (for instance, the "center of excellence" can provide regular
    reporting towards the financial departments) and, if the tracking is
    done right, can even suggest improvements in the architecture or
    deployments to further minimize license cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT teams can freely focus on the solution that they are building for
    the customer without the need to duplicate software installation
    methods and different patching processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing these services from a "center of excellence", you
definitely reduce certain research &amp;amp; development costs - without this
offering, each team would need to develop processes to deploy software
and track its usage. This is independent of the internal customer and as
such, consolidation is a definite win here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this service is offered, the "center of excellence" can focus on
the services that they can provide and which are &lt;strong&gt;mandatory for all
internal customers&lt;/strong&gt; (not "usable", but mandatory) and for which little
flexibility (in design or development) is possible. There are not that
many cases here, and this is very specific to each technology and
organization in which the software is made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a hypothetical example, consider an LDAP service. The "center of
excellence" might want to provide auditing (and alignment with an
organization standard auditing system) if the organization has a policy
that auditing is mandatory, regardless of the project for which LDAP is
used. Of course, if the "center of excellence" wants to stop at this
service offering (i.e. the previously mentioned installation/tracking,
and now auditing) then this is most likely a best practice document
geared towards the IT teams that need to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit? The IT teams are in this case aware of the requirement
(auditing must be enabled) and do not need to investigate how to do this
anymore (it is already documented).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third level of service offering that I see is the &lt;strong&gt;reusable,
customer-independent services&lt;/strong&gt; that one wants to provide on the
software. For a database, this might mean alignment with the
organizations' backup infrastructure. For an LDAP, that might mean
getting feeds from a central source (be it a central LDAP
infrastructure, an Identity Management system, ...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you consider providing this service (which is usually the case in
larger environments), take special care that the service you want to
offer is flexible enough so that any IT team can work with it. A service
that is only applicable to 70% of your internal customers will not do
it. For an LDAP service, this might mean that you provide out-of-the-box
configuration templates, best practice information for its back-end
infrastructure (which includes backup/restore operations), ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But make sure that you are not redesigning and re-developing what your
product already provides. I have seen numerous cases where teams develop
tools that should "shield the complexity" from the end user, but in
effect are creating additional layers of clouds and complexity instead.
If you want or need to abstract complexity from the user, make sure that
this is only a single layer that you are introducing. The moment you are
creating tools on top of previously written tools, you should reconsider
your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, "centers of excellence" want to rewrite documentation for the end
users. They feel that the documentation available from the vendor is too
complex for IT teams to use. Although I can relate to that, they should
not underestimate the expertise within the IT teams. If the IT teams do
not want to gain the knowledge or experience through the product guides,
then they are less likely to properly maintain and troubleshoot the
product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such cases, I would wager that it is more beneficial for the
organization to look at their (human) resources and their relation to
the software. In times like these, where cloud solutions play an
important role, my suggestion would be to consolidate the software usage
towards a SaaS principle (&lt;strong&gt;Software-as-a-Service&lt;/strong&gt;) managed by an
experienced team (or teams). This does not mean that the "center of
excellence" has to play this role, but it does sound like a logical step
for them. After all, if the "center of excellence" only defines
additional services without actually consuming them, they might lose
track of the product in real-case scenario's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a web server for example - Apache. You might have a "center of
excellence" for Apache web servers, which provides easily deployable
packages. They might provide example configuration files as well as
pointers towards Apache's documentation (and best practices). They track
the deployments and ensure that security patches are available as soon
as possible. But they should guard over the rest of the services that
they want to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would that team create a framework for auto-generating configuration
files? What is the benefit of this for the entire organization, for each
customer? If the IT team can take care of the configuration, let them
be. But if those IT teams would rather not manage these web servers
themselves, what is the point in creating additional frameworks to "hide
the complexity"? It is, imo, much more efficient to see if you cannot
provide web hosting services instead, and have the IT teams "buy" these
(internal) web hosting services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many advantages to this: the web hosting environment is
managed by a team of experts, can be consolidated to keep the TCO low,
can provide default configurations that are fully aligned with the
organization but still offer the flexibility that individual customers
might require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same goes for other software products: java application servers (like
JBoss or IBM WebSphere AS), databases (Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL or
Postgresql), messaging systems, log servers, LDAP services, file share
services, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about you - how do you position "centre of excellence" teams?
Can you relate with such a "back to basics" approach, or would you
rather see a fully integrated, standardized solution roll-out where IT
teams only have experience with the organization-only frameworks?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>About time...</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2011/02/about-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-24T21:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-02-24T21:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2011-02-24:/2011/02/about-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was just wondering why "UTC" stood for "Coordinated Universal Time".

&lt;p&gt;It is a simple manager with no user interface for managing it at all -
