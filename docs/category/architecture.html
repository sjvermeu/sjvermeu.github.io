                </h5>
                <span class="small">by <a href="https://blog.siphos.be/author/sven-vermeulen.html">Sven Vermeulen</a>, post on <span class="text-success">Fri 25 December 2020</span></span>
                <p><p>IT is complex. Some even consider it to be more magic than reality. And with
the ongoing evolutions and inventions, the complexity is not really going
away. Sure, some IT areas are becoming easier to understand, but that is often
offset with new areas being explored.</p>
<p>Companies and organizations that have a sizeable IT footprint generally see an
increase in their infrastructure, regardless of how many rationalization
initiatives that are started. Personally, I find it challenging, in a fun
way, to keep up with the onslaught of new technologies and services that are
onboarded in the infrastructure landscape that I'm responsible for.</p>
<p>But just understanding a technology isn't enough to deal with its position in
the larger environment.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity is a challenging beast</strong></p>
<p>If someone were to attempt drawing out how the IT infrastructure of a larger
IT environment looks like in reality, it would soon become very, very large and
challenging to explain. Perhaps not chaotic, but definitely complicated.</p>
<p>One of the challenges is the amount of "something" that is out there. That can
be the amount of devices you have, the amount of servers in the network, the
amount of flows going through firewalls or gateways, the amount of processes
running on a server, the amount of workstations and end user devices in use,
the amount of containers running in the container platform, the amount of cloud
platform instances that are active... </p>
<p>The "something" can even be less tangible than the previous examples such as
the amount of projects that are being worked on in parallel or the amount of
changes that are being prepared. However, that complexity is not one I'll deal
with in this post.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the virtualized nature of IT infrastructure, which has
a huge benefit for the organization and simplifies infrastructure services
for its own consumers, but does make it more, well, complicated to deal with.</p>
<p>Virtual networks (vlans), virtual systems (hypervisors), virtual firewalls,
virtual applications (with support for streaming desktop applications to the
end user device without having the applications installed on that device),
virtual storage environments, etc. are all wonderful technologies which allow
for much more optimized resource usage, but does introduce a higher complexity
of the infastructure at large.</p>
<p>To make sense of such larger structures, we start making abstractions of what
we see, structuring it in a way that we can more easily explain, assess or analyze
the environment and support changes properly. These abstract views do reflect
reality, but only to a certain extend. Not every question that can be asked can
be answered satisfactory with the same abstract view, but when it can, it is very
effective.</p>
<p><strong>Abstracting service complexity</strong></p>
<p>In my day-to-day job, I'm responsible for the infrastructure of a reasonably
large environment. With "responsible" I don't want to imply that I'm the one
and only party involved of course - responsibilities are across a range of
people and roles. I am accountable for the long-term strategy on
infrastructure and the high-level infrastructure architecture and its offerings,
but how that plays out is a collaborative aspect.</p>
<p>Because of this role, I do want to keep a close eye on all the services that
we offer from infrastructure side of things. And hence, I am often confronted
with the complexity mentioned earlier. To resolve this, I try to look at all
infastructure services in an abstract way, and document it in the same way so
that services are more easily explained.</p>
<p><img alt="An Archimate based view on the abstractions listed" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/202012/abstracting-infrastructure-complexity-kvm.png"/></p>
<p><em>Figure 1 - A possible visualization of the abstraction model, here in Archimate</em></p>
<p>The abstraction I apply is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start with <em>components</em>, building blocks that are used and which refer
  to a single product or technology out there. A specific Java product can
  be considered such a component, because by itself it hardly has any value.</li>
<li>Components are put together to create a <em>solution</em>. This is something that
  is intended to provide value to the organization at large, and is the level
  at which something is documented, has an organizational entity responsible
  for it, etc. Solutions are not yet instantiated though. An example of a
  solution could be a Kafka-based pub/sub solution, or an OpenLDAP-based
  directory solution.</li>
<li>Solutions are used to create <em>services</em>. A service is something that has
  an SLA attached to it. In most cases, the same solution is used to create
  multiple services. We can think of the Kafka-based pub/sub solution that
  has three services in the organization: a regular non-production one,
  a regular production one, and a highly available production service.</li>
<li>Services are supported through one or more <em>clusters</em>. These are a
  way for teams to organize resources in support of a service. Some services
  might be supported by multiple clusters, for instance spread across
  different data centers. An OpenLDAP-based service might be supported by
  a single OpenLDAP cluster with native synchronization support spread across
  two data centers, or by two OpenLDAP clusters with a different
  synchronization mechanism between the two clusters.</li>
<li>Clusters exist out of one or more <em>instances</em>. These are the actual deployed
  technology processes that enable the cluster. In an OpenLDAP cluster, you
  could have two master processes (<code>slapd</code> processes) running, which are the
  instances within the cluster.</li>
<li>On top of the clusters, we enable <em>containers</em> (I call those containers, but
  they don't have anything to do with container technology like Docker containers).
  The containers are what the consumers are actually interested in. That could
  be an organization unit in an LDAP structure, a database within an RDBMS, 
  a set of topics within a Kafka cluster, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basic abstractions I apply for most of the technologies, allowing
me to easily make a good view on the environment. Let's look at a few examples
here.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Virtualization of Wintel systems</strong></p>
<p>In a large, virtualized environment, you generally have a specific hypervisor
software being used: be it RHV (Red Hat Virtualization) based upon
KVM, Microsoft HyperV, VMWare vSphere or something else - the technology used
is generally well known. That's one of the components being used, but that is
far from the only component.</p>
<p>To better manage the virtualized environment the administration teams might
use an orchestration engine like Ansible, Puppet or Saltstack. They might also
have a component in use for automatically managing certificates and what not.</p>
<p>All these components are needed to build a full virtualization solution. For
me, as an architect, knowing which components are used is useful for things
like lifecycle management (which components are EOL, which components can be
easily replaced with a different one versus components that are more lock-in
oriented, etc.) or inventory management (which component is deployed where,
which version is used), which supports things like vulnerability management
(if we can map components to their Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) then
we can easily see which vulnerabilities are reported through the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) reports).</p>
<p>The interaction between all these components creates a sensible solution,
which is the virtualization solution. At this level, I'm mostly interested
in the solution roadmap, the responsibilities and documentation associated
with it, the costs, maturity of the offering within the organization, etc.
It is also on the solution level that most architectural designs are made,
and the best practices (and malpractices) are documented.</p>
<p>The virtualization solution itself is then instantiated within the
organization to create one or more services. These could be different
services based on the environment (a lab/sandbox virtualization service
with low to no SLA, a non-production one with standard SLA, a non-production
one with specific disaster recovery requirements, a production one with
standard SLA (and standard disaster recovery requirements), a high-performance
production one, etc.</p>
<p>These services are mostly important for other architects, project leads
or other stakeholders that are going to make active use of the virtualization
services - the different services (which one could document as "service
plans") make it more obvious on what the offering is, and what differentiation
is supported.</p>
<p>Let's consider a production, standard SLA virtualization service. The
system administrators of the virtualization environment might enable this
service across multiple clusters. This could be for several reasons: this
could be due to limits (maximum number of hosts per cluster), or because
of particular resource requirements (different CPU architecture requirements
- yes even with virtualization this is still a thing), or to make
things manageable for the administrators in general.</p>
<p>While knowing which cluster an application is on is, in general, not
that important, it can be very important when there are problems, or when
limits are being reached. As an architect, I'm definitely interested in
knowing why multiple clusters are made (what is the reasoning behind it) as
it gives a good view on what the administrators are generally dealing with.</p>
<p>Within a cluster (to support the virtualization) you'll find multiple hosts.
Often, a cluster is sized to be able to deal with one or two host fall-outs
so that the virtual machines (which are hosted on the cluster - these are
the "containers" that I spoke of) can be migrated to another host with only
a short downtime as a consequence (if their main host crashed) or no downtime
at all (if it is scheduled maintenance of the host). These hosts are the
instances of the cluster.</p>
<p>By using this abstraction, I can "map" the virtualization environment in
a way that I have a good enough view, without proclaiming to be anything
more than an informed architect, on this setup to support my own work,
and to be able to advice management on major investment requirements,
challenges, strategic evolutions and more.</p>
<p><strong>More than just documentation</strong></p>
<p>While the above method is used for documenting the environment in which
I work (and which works well for the size of the environment I have to deal
with), it can be used for simplifying management of the technologies as
well. This level of abstraction can easily be used in environments that
push self-servicing forward.</p>
<p>Let's take the <a href="https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/">Open Service Broker API</a>
as an example. This is an API that defines how to expose (infrastructure)
services to consumers that can easily create (provision) and destroy 
(deprovision) their own services. Brokers that support the API will
then automatically handle the service management. This model can easily
be put in to support the previous abstraction.</p>
<p>Take the virtualization environment again. If we want to enable self-servicing
on a virtualized environment, we can think of an offering where internal customers
can create new virtual machines (provision) either based on a company-vetted
template, or through an image (like with virtual appliances). The team that
manages the virtualization environment has a number of services, which they
describe in the service plans exposed by the API. An internal customer, when
privisioning a virtual machine, is thus creating a "container" for the right
service (based on their selected service plan) and on the right cluster
(based upon the parameters that the internal customer passes along with the
creation of its machine).</p>
<p>We can do the same with databases: a certain database solution (say PostgreSQL)
has its own offerings (exposed through service plans linked to the service), and
internal customers can create their own database ("container") on the right
cluster through this API.</p>
<p>I personally have a few scripts that I use at home myself to quickly set
up a certain technology, using the above abstraction level as the foundation.
Rather than having to try and remember how to set up a multi-master OpenLDAP
service, or a replicated Kafka setup, I have scripts that create this based
upon this abstraction: the script parameters always use the service, cluster,
instance and container terminology and underlyingly map this to the
technology-specific approach.</p>
<p>It is my intention to also promote this abstraction usage within my
work environment, as I believe it allows us to more easily explain what
all the infrastructure is used for, but also to more easily get new employees
known to our environment. But even if that isn't reached, the abstraction is
a huge help for me to assess and understand the multitude of technologies
that are out there, be it our mainframe setup, the SAN offerings, the
network switching setup, the databases, messaging services, cloud
landing zones, firewall setups, container platforms and more.</p>

With my day job becoming more intensive and my side-job taking the remainder
of the time, I've since quit my work on the Gentoo project. I am in process

probably discuss that more later.</p>

                <p><p><sub>This is a long read, skip to “Prioritizing the projects and changes” for the
approach details...</sub></p>
<p>Organizations and companies generally have an IT workload (dare I say,
backlog?) which needs to be properly assessed, prioritized and taken up.
Sometimes, the IT team(s) get an amount of budget and HR resources to "do their
thing", while others need to continuously ask for approval to launch a new
project or instantiate a change.</p>
<p>Sizeable organizations even require engineering and development effort on IT
projects which are not readily available: specialized teams exist, but they are
governance-wise assigned to projects. And as everyone thinks their project is
the top-most priority one, many will be disappointed when they hear there are
no resources available for their pet project.</p>
<p>So... how should organizations prioritize such projects?</p>

                <p><p>Many organizations struggle with the all-time increase in IP address
allocation and the accompanying need for segmentation. In the past, governing
the segments within the organization means keeping close control over the
service deployments, firewall rules, etc.</p>
<p>Lately, the idea of micro-segmentation, supported through software-defined
networking solutions, seems to defy the need for a segmentation governance.
However, I think that that is a very short-sighted sales proposition. Even
with micro-segmentation, or even pure point-to-point / peer2peer communication
flow control, you'll still be needing a high level overview of the services
within your scope.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I'll give some insights in how we are approaching this in
the company I work for. In short, it starts with requirements gathering,
creating labels to assign to deployments, creating groups based on one or two
labels in a layered approach, and finally fixating the resulting schema and
start mapping guidance documents (policies) toward the presented architecture.</p>

a couple of technological domains, namely databases and scheduling/workload

                <p><p>With the high attention that technologies such as <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>,
<a href="https://coreos.com/blog/rocket/">Rocket</a> and the like get (I recommend to look at 
<a href="https://github.com/p8952/bocker">Bocker</a> by Peter Wilmott as well ;-), I
still find it important that technologies are well capable of supporting a
multi-instance environment.</p>
<p>Being able to run multiple instances makes for great consolidation. The system
can be optimized for the technology, access to the system limited to the admins
of said technology while still providing isolation between instances. For some
technologies, running on commodity hardware just doesn't cut it (not all 
software is written for such hardware platforms) and consolidation allows for
reducing (hardware/licensing) costs.</p>
