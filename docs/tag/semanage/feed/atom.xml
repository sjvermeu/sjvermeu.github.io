&lt;p&gt;But completely putting the system in permissive mode is overshooting. It
is much easier to make a very simple policy to start with, and then mark
the domain as a permissive domain. What happens is that the software
then, after transitioning into the "simple" domain, is not part of the
SELinux enforcements anymore whereas the rest of the system remains in
SELinux enforcing mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, create a minuscule policy like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;policy_module(testdom, 1.0)

type testdom_t;
type testdom_exec_t;
init_daemon_domain(testdom_t, testdom_exec_t)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark the executable for the daemon as &lt;code&gt;testdom_exec_t&lt;/code&gt; (after building
and loading the minuscule policy):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~# chcon -t testdom_exec_t /opt/something/bin/daemond
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, tell SELinux that &lt;code&gt;testdom_t&lt;/code&gt; is to be seen as a permissive
domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~# semanage permissive -a testdom_t
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When finished, don't forget to remove the permissive bit
(&lt;code&gt;semanage permissive -d testdom_t&lt;/code&gt;) and unload/remove the SELinux
policy module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. If the daemon is now started (through a standard init
script) it will run as &lt;code&gt;testdom_t&lt;/code&gt; and everything it does will be
logged, but not enforced by SELinux. That might even help in
understanding the application better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="SELinux"></category><category term="permissive"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="semanage"></category><category term="test"></category></entry><entry><title>Migrating to SELinux userspace 2.4 (small warning for users)</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2014/10/migrating-to-selinux-userspace-2-4-small-warning-for-users/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-30T19:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-30T19:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2014-10-30:/2014/10/migrating-to-selinux-userspace-2-4-small-warning-for-users/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a few moments, SELinux users which have the \~arch KEYWORDS set

(either globally or for the SELinux utilities in particular) will notice
that the SELinux userspace will upgrade to version 2.4 (release
candidate 5 for now). This upgrade comes with a manual step that needs
to be performed after upgrade. The information is mentioned as
post-installation message of the &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils&lt;/code&gt; package, and
basically sais that you need to execute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~# /usr/libexec/selinux/semanage_migrate_store
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that the SELinux utilities expect the SELinux policy
module store (and the semanage related files) to be in
&lt;code&gt;/var/lib/selinux&lt;/code&gt; and no longer in &lt;code&gt;/etc/selinux&lt;/code&gt;. Note that this does
not mean that the SELinux policy itself is moved outside of that
location, nor is the basic configuration file (&lt;code&gt;/etc/selinux/config&lt;/code&gt;).
It is what tools such as &lt;strong&gt;semanage&lt;/strong&gt; manage that is moved outside that
location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to automate the migration as part of the packages themselves,
but this would require the &lt;code&gt;portage_t&lt;/code&gt; domain to be able to move,
rebuild and load policies, which it can't (and to be honest, shouldn't).
Instead of augmenting the policy or making updates to the migration
script as delivered by the upstream project, we currently decided to
have the migration done manually. It is a one-time migration anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for some reason end users forget to do the migration, then that does
not mean that the system breaks or becomes unusable. SELinux still
works, SELinux aware applications still work; the only thing that will
fail are updates on the SELinux configuration through tools like
&lt;strong&gt;semanage&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;setsebool&lt;/strong&gt; - the latter when you want to persist
boolean changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~# semanage fcontext -l
ValueError: SELinux policy is not managed or store cannot be accessed.

~# setsebool -P allow_ptrace on
Cannot set persistent booleans without managed policy.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get those errors or warnings, all that is left to do is to do the
migration. Note in the following that there is a warning about 'else'
blocks that are no longer supported: that's okay, as far as I know (and
it was mentioned on the upstream mailinglist as well as not something to
worry about) it does not have any impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~# /usr/libexec/selinux/semanage_migrate_store
Migrating from /etc/selinux/mcs/modules/active to /var/lib/selinux/mcs/active
Attempting to rebuild policy from /var/lib/selinux
sysnetwork: Warning: &amp;#39;else&amp;#39; blocks in optional statements are unsupported in CIL. Dropping from output.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also add in &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; so that the old policy module store is cleaned
up. You can also rerun the command multiple times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~# /usr/libexec/selinux/semanage_migrate_store -c
warning: Policy type mcs has already been migrated, but modules still exist in the old store. Skipping store.
Attempting to rebuild policy from /var/lib/selinux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can manually clean up the old policy module store like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~# rm -rf /etc/selinux/mcs/modules
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... don't worry - the change is small and does not break stuff. And
for those wondering about CIL I'll talk about it in one of my next
posts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="cil"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="migrate"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="semanage"></category><category term="upgrade"></category><category term="userspace"></category></entry><entry><title>If things are weird, check for policy.29</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2014/04/if-things-are-weird-check-for-policy-29/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-17T21:01:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-04-17T21:01:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2014-04-17:/2014/04/if-things-are-weird-check-for-policy-29/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we analyzed a weird issue one of our SELinux users had with their

system. He had a denial when calling &lt;strong&gt;audit2allow&lt;/strong&gt;, informing us that
&lt;code&gt;sysadm_t&lt;/code&gt; had no rights to read the SELinux policy. This is a known
issue that has been resolved in our current SELinux policy repository
but which needs to be pushed to the tree (which is my job, sorry about
that). The problem however is when he added the policy - it didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, &lt;strong&gt;sesearch&lt;/strong&gt; told us that the policy has been modified
correctly - but it still doesn't work. Check your policy with
&lt;strong&gt;sestatus&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;seinfo&lt;/strong&gt; and they're all saying things are working
well. And yet ... things don't. Apparently, all policy changes are
ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? There was a &lt;code&gt;policy.29&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/selinux/mcs/policy&lt;/code&gt;
which was always loaded, even though the user already edited
&lt;code&gt;/etc/selinux/semanage.conf&lt;/code&gt; to have &lt;code&gt;policy-version&lt;/code&gt; set to 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is already a problem that we need to tell users to edit
&lt;code&gt;semanage.conf&lt;/code&gt; to a fixed version (because binary version 29 is not
supported by most Linux kernels as it has been very recently introduced)
but having &lt;strong&gt;load_policy&lt;/strong&gt; (which is called by &lt;strong&gt;semodule&lt;/strong&gt; when a
policy needs to be loaded) loading a stale &lt;code&gt;policy.29&lt;/code&gt; file is just...
disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway - if you see weird behavior, check both the &lt;code&gt;semanage.conf&lt;/code&gt; file
(and set &lt;code&gt;policy-version = 28&lt;/code&gt;) as well as the contents of your
&lt;code&gt;/etc/selinux/*/policy&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you see any &lt;code&gt;policy.*&lt;/code&gt; that isn't
version 28, delete them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="SELinux"></category><category term="load_policy"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="semanage"></category></entry></feed>
