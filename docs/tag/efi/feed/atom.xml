the AMD64 one, and if those support UEFI, but the instructions are
shared and they don't collide). The entire EFI stuff can probably be
improved a lot, but basically the things that were added are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boot the system using UEFI already if possible (which is needed for
    efibootmgr to access the EFI variables). This is not entirely
    mandatory (as efibootmgr is not mandatory to boot a system)
    but recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use vfat for the &lt;code&gt;/boot/&lt;/code&gt; location, as this now becomes the EFI
    System Partition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configure the Linux kernel to support EFI stub and EFI variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install the Linux kernel as the &lt;code&gt;bootx64.efi&lt;/code&gt; file to boot the
    system with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use efibootmgr to add boot options (if required) and create an EFI
    boot entry called "Gentoo"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find grave errors, please do mention them (either on a talk page
on the wiki, as a &lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; or through IRC) so it
is picked up. All developers and trusted contributors on the wiki have
access to the files so can edit where needed (but do take care that, if
something is edited, that it is either architecture-specific or shared
across all architectures - check the page when editing; if it is
&lt;em&gt;Handbook:Parts&lt;/em&gt; then it is shared, and &lt;em&gt;Handbook:AMD64&lt;/em&gt; is specific for
the architecture). And if I'm online I'll of course act on it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and no - it is not a bug that there is a (now not used) &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda1&lt;/code&gt;
"bios" partition. Due to the differences with the possible installation
alternatives, it is easier for us (me) to just document a common
partition layout than to try and write everything out (making it just
harder for new users to follow the instructions).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="efi"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="handbook"></category><category term="uefi"></category></entry><entry><title>Switching to new laptop</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2014/08/switching-to-new-laptop/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-08-19T22:11:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-08-19T22:11:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2014-08-19:/2014/08/switching-to-new-laptop/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm slowly but surely starting to switch to a new laptop.

hasn't completely died (yet) but given that I had to force its CPU
frequency at the lowest Hz or the CPU would burn (and the system
suddenly shut down due to heat issues), and that the connection between
the battery and laptop fails (so even new battery didn't help out) so I
couldn't use it as a laptop... well, let's say the new laptop is welcome
;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building Gentoo isn't an issue (having only a few hours per day to work
on it is) and while I'm at it, I'm also experimenting with EFI
(currently still without secure boot, but with EFI) and such.
Considering that the Gentoo Handbook needs quite a few updates (and I'm
thinking to do more than just small updates) knowing how EFI works is a
Good Thing (tm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested - the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EFI_stub_kernel"&gt;EFI stub
kernel&lt;/a&gt; instructions in
the article on the wiki, and also in Greg's wonderful post on &lt;a href="http://kroah.com/log/blog/2013/09/02/booting-a-self-signed-linux-kernel/"&gt;booting a
self-signed Linux
kernel&lt;/a&gt;
(which I will do later) work pretty well. I didn't try out the "Adding
more kernels" section in it, as I need to be able to (sometimes) edit
the boot options (which isn't easy to accomplish with EFI
stub-supporting kernels afaics). So I installed
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gummiboot"&gt;Gummiboot&lt;/a&gt; (and created a wiki
article on it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things still planned, so little time. But at least building
chromium is now a bit faster - instead of 5 hours and 16 minutes, I can
now enjoy the newer versions after little less than 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="efi"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="laptop"></category></entry></feed>
