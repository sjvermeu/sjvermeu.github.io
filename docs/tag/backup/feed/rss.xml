they work). Taking backups is not purely for companies and organizations.
Individuals should also take backups to ensure that, in case of errors or
calamities, the all important files are readily recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For backing up files and directories, I personally use &lt;a href="http://obnam.org/"&gt;obnam&lt;/a&gt;,
after playing around with &lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org/"&gt;Bacula&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://attic-backup.org/"&gt;attic&lt;/a&gt;. Bacula is more meant for large
distributed environments (although I also tend to use obnam for my server
infrastructure) and was too complex for my taste. The choice between obnam and
attic is even more personally-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
