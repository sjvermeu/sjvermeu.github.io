recently and found that it, by itself, is already useful enough to publish. It
is a conceptual data model for IT services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The IT model, and why it is useful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conceptual data model for IT services supports several IT processes, with a
strong focus on &lt;em&gt;asset management&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;configuration management&lt;/em&gt;. Many IT
vendors that have solutions active within those processes will have their own
data model in place, but I often feel that their models have room for
improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these models are too fine-grained, others are limited to server
infrastructure. And while most applications allow for further customization, I
feel that an IT architect should have a conceptual model in mind for their
actions and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conceptual data model that I'm currently working on looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An IT CDM, first version" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/202201/it-cdm-v1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention is to update this CDM with new insights when I capture those. It is
not my intention to further develop the data model into a physical data model,
but perhaps in the long term I could make it a conceptual one (explaining what
the attributes are of each concept).&lt;/p&gt;
