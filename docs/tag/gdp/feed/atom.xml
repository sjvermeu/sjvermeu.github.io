amd64) with the intent to have better instructions on GPT (GUID
Partition Table) layout versus MBR (Master Boot Record) or MSDOS-style
layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part on "Preparing the Disks" saw the most changes. It starts with
explaining the differences between the two layouts with advantages and
disadvantages. It then helps the user decide what layout is best for him
(or her).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt; (and let me stress that one out again, because
many people have reported bugs on it: it is an &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt;) partition
layout now includes a BIOS boot partition in the beginning, 2 MB in
size. This is to support GRUB2 on GPT, but doesn't hurt for GRUB2 with
the MSDOS-style layout either. That means that the partition numbers now
move up one (the &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt; /boot is now at sda2, the swap at sda3 and
root on sda4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partitioning instructions now also include the proper alignment
instructions (using MB alignment), and use parted as the default
partitioning method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are submitted to CVS so will show up on the Gentoo site in
an hour or so (documentation on the sites is synchronized hourly if I'm
not mistaken). Please do give it a good read and report bugs on
&lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org"&gt;bugs.gentoo.org&lt;/a&gt;. You might also want to ping
me on IRC if it is urgent, although no guarantees that I'm behind my
computer at any point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="fdisk"></category><category term="gdp"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="gpt"></category><category term="handbook"></category><category term="mbr"></category><category term="parted"></category></entry><entry><title>Majority of GDP documents moved to Gentoo wiki</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/12/majority-of-gdp-documents-moved-to-gentoo-wiki/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-10T16:03:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-12-10T16:03:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-12-10:/2013/12/majority-of-gdp-documents-moved-to-gentoo-wiki/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The majority of the English gentoo documents that resided in

&lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en"&gt;www.gentoo.org/doc/en&lt;/a&gt; have now been
moved to the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. All those documents
have been made available in the main namespace, meaning that
non-developers can continue to contribute on those articles and guides,
fully in the spirit of a wiki and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now working on &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Documentation/Overview"&gt;a method for displaying an overview of
documents&lt;/a&gt;
that have been moved, or have seen enough development on the wiki that
they are deemed of proper quality and stable (not too many changes
left). Currently, such documents are (requested to be) marked for
translation, allowing me or other developers to review if the guides are
indeed ok to move forward. If so, they are marked as translatable
(allowing the various translation members on the wiki to move forward
with translating the guides) and will be made part of the overview as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few documents that has not been moved yet is the Gentoo
Handbook as it is of a different format than the guides, and includes
dynamic documentation generation features which I have yet to fully
investigate (wiki-wise). I currently focused mainly on the non-handbook
guides, so the handbook itself will get more attention later (after the
documentation overview is completed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:A3li"&gt;Alex Legler&lt;/a&gt; for
assisting me and providing the necessary features and functionality in
the Gentoo wiki to make this all possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the translation
support provided by the infrastructure, all "reasons" not to go forward
with this have been resolved. At first, I'm focusing on documentation
with open bugs that have not been picked up (usually due to (human)
resource limits), but other documents will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of already moved documents are the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration"&gt;Xorg configuration
guide&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GCC_optimization"&gt;GCC
optimization guide&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/UTF-8"&gt;UTF-8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User-mode_Linux/System_testing_with_UML"&gt;System testing with
UML&lt;/a&gt;.
Many more have been moved as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migrations are assisted by a conversion script that translates
GuideXML into wiki style content, although manual corrections remain
needed. For instance, all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre caption="..."&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; stuff is changed into
&lt;code&gt;{{Code|...}}&lt;/code&gt; even though the Wiki has several templates for code, such
as &lt;code&gt;{{Kernel|...}}&lt;/code&gt; for kernel configurations, &lt;code&gt;{{RootCmd|...}}&lt;/code&gt; for
commands ran as a privileged user and &lt;code&gt;{{Cmd|...}}&lt;/code&gt; for unprivileged
user commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I updated the &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/list.xml"&gt;documentation
list&lt;/a&gt; on the main Gentoo site to
reflect the movement of documents as well, as this list will be slowly
shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Documentation"></category><category term="docs"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="gdp"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="wiki"></category></entry><entry><title>Added "predictable network interface" info into the handbook</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/05/added-predictable-network-interface-info-into-the-handbook/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-07T03:50:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-05-07T03:50:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-05-07:/2013/05/added-predictable-network-interface-info-into-the-handbook/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being long overdue - like many of our documentation-reported bugs :-( I

documentation-related ones soon. I had some problems with the new
SELinux userspace that I wanted to get fixed before, and then I worked
on the new SELinux policies as well as trying to figure out how SELinux
deals with network related aspects. Hence I saw time fly by at the speed
of a neutrino...&lt;/p&gt;
