whose policies I don't agree with) it is often more difficult to finish
the policies so that they are broadly usable. When dealing with personal
policies, having them "just work" is often sufficient. To make the
policies reusable for distributions (or for the upstream project), a
number of things are necessary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try structuring the policy using the style as suggested by refpolicy
    or Gentoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the role interfaces that are most likely to be used or required,
    or which are in the current draft implemented differently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor some of the policies to use refpolicy/Gentoo style
    interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the comments from the policies (as refpolicy does not want
    too verbose policies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change or update the file context definitions for default
    installations (rather than the custom installations I use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
