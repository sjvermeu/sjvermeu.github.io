&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolchain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few patches on the toolchain need to be created to mark SSP as
default, but this is just a minor workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/"&gt;ASAN (Address
Sanitizer)&lt;/a&gt; debacle;
well... still the same. Doesn't work with PaX. I think there is a
standstill on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel, grsecurity/PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear yet what the next LTS (Long Term Stable) kernel will be
that the &lt;a href="https://grsecurity.net/"&gt;grSecurity&lt;/a&gt; team will support. This
depends on the Ubuntu LTS support, and as it is not clear which kernel
that distribution will use for LTS, the grSecurity team can also not say
what kernel it will be. (So please stop asking ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grsecurity 3.0 is out, with the following commit message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;commit 4f48151d49f2697c3e2e108a50513a8d61fb150d
Author: Brad Spengler 
Date:   Sun Nov 24 17:47:14 2013 -0500

    Version bumped to 3.0 (we&amp;#39;d been on 2.9.1 for way too long and numerous
    features have been added since then)

    Introduce new atomic RBAC reload method, developed as part of sponsorship
    by EIG

    This is accompanied by an updated 3.0 gradm which will use the new reload
    method when -R is passed to gradm.  The old method will still be available
    via gradm -r (which is what a 2.9.1 gradm will continue to use).

    The new RBAC reload method is atomic in the sense that at no point in the
    reload process will the system not be covered by a coherent full policy.
    In contrast to previous reload behavior, it also preserves inherited subjects
    and special roles.

    The old RBAC reload method has also been made atomic.  Both methods have
    been updated to perform role_allowed_ip checks only against the IP tagged
    to the task at the time its role was first applied or changed.  This resolves
    long-standing usability problems with the use of role_allowed_ip and matches
    the policies created by learning.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new version requires the use of &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=gradm-3.0&lt;/code&gt;. Some hardened-sources
packages already contain the 3.0 patchset (currently in testing). In a
few days, a final hardened-sources with a 2.9.1 patchset will be
stabilized; after that, only 3.0 patchset sources will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another open issue (for a while) is the &lt;code&gt;install.py&lt;/code&gt; wrapper used to
properly pax-mark binaries during package building (instead of
post-merge changes). Although it works functionally well, it has serious
performance regressions when hundreds of files need to be merged and
marked. For each file, the Python interpreter is launched again, making
this a very time-consuming effort. Blueness is currently working on a
C-based wrapper which should load much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The live repository of the Gentoo Hardened policies is well up to date
with the latest evolutions of the reference policy. If you want to use
these, use the &lt;code&gt;-9999&lt;/code&gt; ebuilds for the SELinux policy packages. This can
be accomplished with the following line in
&lt;path&gt;package.accept_keywords&lt;/path&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sec-policy/* **
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, revision 5 of the SELinux policies has been pushed to the tree
(currently in testing). This one also contains a few required changes to
the policy for the new userspace utilities which are also now available
in the tree. An important update on the new userspace utilities is that
they contain many of the patches we needed in Gentoo and of course the
necessary updates, patches and improvements all-round. Once the SELinux
policies are stabilized, the userspace utilities will be too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few successful runs with SELinux on ARM devices, we will most
likely be tagging our SELinux packages (policies and userspace
utilities) as &lt;code&gt;~arm&lt;/code&gt;. Documentation will need to be updated on this as
well, not only to cater for the additional keyword, but also because of
one (perhaps a few) changes needed, like fixing the SELinux binary
policy (as most ARM systems come with a lower kernel version).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELinux support on ZFS also seems to work well, with the last patches in
(thanks to prometheanfire).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final aspect, the SELinux eclass in Gentoo Linux now also supports
fetching the latest policy sources from git through HTTP (instead of
git/ssh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to discuss here; IMA/EVM and kernel signing all work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few days/weeks, I will be working on a &lt;a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/docs/security_benchmarks/gentoo.html"&gt;Gentoo Security
Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;
as a sort-of follow-up (improvement) of the current &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/security/"&gt;Gentoo Security
Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, now using SCAP
methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been discussion about supporting a &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/security/"&gt;hardened desktop
profile&lt;/a&gt; in Gentoo again. This
does come with the nasty surprise that these profiles don't play well
together, so a solution needs to be brought in place. This could be a
"hardened desktop" profile separate from the gentoo desktop one (and as
such manually synchronized), or an improved approach on profile
stacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea was to support stacking with a maximum depth, allowing to use
changes made by a profile without inheriting the changes that that
profile inherited to a certain extend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to use a more dependency-based syntax (similar to OpenRC
dependency system for init scripts), which not only allows for proper
stacking and the necessary flexibility, but also improves readability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;before {
  hardened/linux/amd64
}
after {
  default/linux/amd64
}
depends {
  targets/desktop/gnome
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few months will be interesting to see how this will evolve ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our documents are on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, so if you
notice gaps or see possibilities for improvement - by all means, do
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a good session.

&lt;p&gt;The 4.8.2 ebuild for GCC is available in the tree, currently still
masked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel and grSecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grSecurity project has made the patches for the 3.12 kernel
available; a hardened 3.12 kernel is available in the
&lt;code&gt;hardened-development&lt;/code&gt; overlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is working on &lt;a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/pull/1835"&gt;ZFSonLinux and
SELinux&lt;/a&gt; support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Steev have been working on SELinux and ARM support. It seems
to work, but kernel versions matter greatly. We might want to open up
ARM keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's about it. As blueness wasn't there as well, the topics were
discussed quite fast. The full logs can be found &lt;a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.hardened/6117"&gt;on the gentoo-hardened

&lt;p&gt;We welcomed Zero_Chaos as a new addition to our team. Big welcome, with
the usual IRC kick in between, ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolchain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC 4.8.x is unmasked and ready for testing. The ASAN problem however is
not resolved and it doesn't look like upstream wants to provide the fix
for this. As a result, if you want to use ASAN, you will need to disable
UDEREF in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difficult problem here is that, if a user forgets to disable UDEREF,
then building with ASAN will fail. If he disabled UDEREF and uses ASAN,
then booting into a UDEREF enabled kernel will fail. If he starts
building with ASAN on UDEREF kernels, things will break. Its ugly, and
unless the ASAN code is changed to support other technologies using the
address space layout information, it will remain mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we'll properly document the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC 4.9 will end its stage1 development phase on November 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uclibc stages are currently built with GCC-4.7.3-r1, except for the
MIPS architectures which use GCC 4.8.1-r1.&lt;br&gt;
The stages are built once every two months, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel grSec/PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard maintenance, such as keeping up with upstream changes, has
taken place. The XATTR problems with the &lt;strong&gt;install&lt;/strong&gt; binary/phase has
not been resolved yet due to time constraints. First focus will be on
writing the C-based wrapper to see if this significantly speeds things
up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;USE=pax_kernel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is ambiguity of the meaning or use of the &lt;code&gt;pax_kernel&lt;/code&gt; USE flag.
It seems to be used for multiple, exclusive things, like limiting builds
on PaX kernels or limiting run-time behavior on PaX kernels. To build
Gentoo images, developers need to set &lt;code&gt;pax_kernel&lt;/code&gt; on some packages and
disable it on others in order for the image to build properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;@blueness&amp;gt; USE=pax_kernel in the case of userland should apply patches etc, that fix the code
            so that it won&amp;#39;t trip pax protection eg mprotect
&amp;lt;@blueness&amp;gt; in the case of kernel modules, it can&amp;#39;t mean that obviously!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the mentioned problems is that some ebuilds only enable pax
markings when &lt;code&gt;pax_kernel&lt;/code&gt; is set. However, that shouldn't be done
conditionally. PaX markings can be done even without a PaX kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero_Chaos (new developers always have the necessary energy) will try
to update ebuilds where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux and System Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing worth mentioning here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many users were using hardened profiles on the desktop. In the past, we
had the desktop/hardened profiles removed (referring users to the
regular hardened profiles and asking them to update their system with
the USE flags (and other settings) they want for their desktop.
Apparently, this is giving some problems for some users, so the idea is
to reinstate the desktop/hardened profiles where the hardened settings
overrule the desktop settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we should take care of tackling the issues we had in the past
(which is the reason why we removed the profiles in the first place). It
is recommended that we discuss this outside the IRC meeting to make sure
we don't reintroduce the issues again while using a flexible approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. A big thanks to the developers, contributors and thousands of
users!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="irc"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="online"></category></entry><entry><title>Gentoo Hardened spring notes</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/05/gentoo-hardened-spring-notes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-16T22:54:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T22:54:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-05-16:/2013/05/gentoo-hardened-spring-notes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We got back together on the &lt;code&gt;#gentoo-hardened&lt;/code&gt; chat channel to discuss

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolchain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC 4.8.1 will be out soon, although nothing major has occurred with it
since the last meeting. There is a plugin header install problem in 4.8
and its not certain that the (trivial) fix is in 4.8.1, but it certainly
is inside Gentoo's release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueness is also (still, and hopefully for a long time ;-) maintaining
the uclibc hardened related toolchain aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel and grSecurity/PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further progress on the XATTR_PAX migration was put on a lower
level the past few weeks due to busy, busy... very busy weeks (but this
was announced and known in advance). We still need to do XATTR copying
in &lt;em&gt;install&lt;/em&gt; for packages that do pax markings before &lt;em&gt;src_install()&lt;/em&gt;
and include the &lt;code&gt;user.pax&lt;/code&gt; XATTR patch in the gentoo-sources kernel.
This will silence the errors for non-hardened users and fix the loss of
XATTR markings for those packages that do pax-mark before install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set then needs to be documented further and tested on vanilla and
hardened systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zorry asked if a separate script can be provided for those ebuilds that
directly call &lt;strong&gt;paxctl&lt;/strong&gt;. These ebuilds might want to switch to the
eclass, but if they need to call &lt;strong&gt;paxctl&lt;/strong&gt; or similar directly (for
instance because the result is immediately used for further building), a
separate script or tool should be made available. Blueness will look
into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;code&gt;hardened-sources&lt;/code&gt;, we are now with stable 2.6.32-r160, 3.2.42-r1 and
3.8.6 due to some vulnerabilities in earlier versions (in networking
code). There is still some bug (nfs-related) that is fixed in 3.2.44 so
that part might need a bump as well soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href="http://blog.siphos.be/2013/04/introducing-selocal-for-small-selinux-policy-enhancements/"&gt;selocal&lt;/a&gt;
command is now available for Gentoo SELinux users, allowing them to
easily enhance the policy without having to maintain their own SELinux
policy modules (the script is a wrapper that does all that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setools package now also uses the &lt;a href="http://blog.siphos.be/2013/04/sloting-the-old-swig-1/"&gt;SLOT'ed
swig&lt;/a&gt;, so no more
dependency breakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On SELinux userspace and policy, both have seen a new release last
month, and both are already in the Gentoo portage tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SELinux policy ebuilds now also call
&lt;a href="http://blog.siphos.be/2013/05/overriding-the-default-selinux-policies/"&gt;epatch_user&lt;/a&gt;
so users can customize the policies even further without having to copy
ebuilds to their overlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;strong&gt;tar&lt;/strong&gt; supports XATTR well, we might want to look into SELinux
stages again. Jmbsvicetto did some work on that, but the builds failed
during stage1. We'll look into that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing much to say, we're waiting a bit until the patches proposed by
the IMA team are merged in the main kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two no-multilib fixes have been applied to the
&lt;code&gt;hardened/amd64/no-multilib&lt;/code&gt; profiles. One was a QA issue and quickly
resolved, the other is due to the profile stacking within Gentoo
profiles, where we missed a profile and thus were missing a few masks
defined in that (missed) profile. But including the profile creates a
lot of duplicates again, so we are going to copy the masks across until
the duplicates are resolved in the other profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueness will also clean up the experimental &lt;code&gt;13.0&lt;/code&gt; directory since all
hardened profiles now follow 13.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest changes on SELinux have been added to the Gentoo SELinux
handbook. Also, I've been slowly (but surely) adding topics to the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Tutorials"&gt;SELinux tutorials
listing&lt;/a&gt; on the Gentoo
wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grSecurity 2 document is very much out of date, blueness hopes to
put some time in fixing that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's about it for the short write-up. Zorry will surely post the
log later on the appropriate channels. Good work done (again) by all
team members!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="irc"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="monthly"></category><category term="online"></category></entry><entry><title>Gentoo Hardened goes onward (aka project meeting)</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/02/gentoo-hardened-goes-onward-aka-project-meeting/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-07T23:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-02-07T23:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-02-07:/2013/02/gentoo-hardened-goes-onward-aka-project-meeting/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been a while again, so time for another Gentoo Hardened online

worked on next week. Some help on it is needed to test the patches on
ARM, PPC and MIPS though. For those interested, keep a close eye on the
hardened-dev overlay as those will contain the latest fixes. When GCC
4.9 starts development phase 1, Zorry will again try to upstream the
patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the coming fixes, we might probably (need to) remove the various
hardenedno* GCC profiles from the hardened Gentoo profiles. This
shouldn't impact too many users as ebuilds add in the correct flags
anyhow (for instance when needing to turn off PIE/PIC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel, grSecurity and PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel release 3.7.0 that we have stable in our tree has seen a few
setbacks, but no higher version is stable yet (mainly due to the
stabilization period needed). 3.7.4-r1 and 3.7.5 are prime candidates
with good track record,&lt;br&gt;
so we might be stabilizing 3.7.5 in the very near future (next week
probably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the PaX flag migration (you know, from ELF-header based marking to
extended attributes marking), the documentation has seen its necessary
upgrades and the userland utilities have been updated to reflect the use
of xattr markings. The eclass we use for the markings will use the
correct utility based on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue faced when trying to support both markings is that some
actions (like the "paxctl -Cc" which creates the PT_PAX header if it is
missing) make no sense with the other (as there is no header when using
XATTR_PAX). The eclass will be updated to ignore these flags when
XATTR_PAX is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision 10 is stable in the tree, and revision 11 is waiting
stabilization period. A few more changes have been put in the policy
repository already (which are installed when using the live ebuilds) and
will of course be part of&lt;br&gt;
revision 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change in the userland utilities was also pushed out to allow
permissive domains (so run a single domain in permissive mode instead of
the entire system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SELinux eclass has been updated to remove SELinux modules
from all defined SELinux module stores if the SELinux policy package is
removed from the system. Before that, the user had to remove the modules
from the store himself manually, but this is error-prone and easily
forgotten, especially for the non-default SELinux policy stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All hardened subprofiles are marked as deprecated now (you've seen the
discussions on this on the mailinglist probably on this) so we now have
a sane set of hardened profiles to manage. The subprofiles were used for
things like&lt;br&gt;
"desktop" or "server", whereas users can easily stack their profiles as
they see fit anyhow - so there was little reason for the project to
continue managing those subprofiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, now that Gentoo has released its 13.0 profile, we will need to
migrate our profiles to the 13.0 ones as well. So, the idea is to
temporarily support 13.0 in a subprofile, test it thoroughly, and then
remove the subprofile and switch the main one to 13.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;System Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for IMA and EVM is available on the Gentoo Hardened
project site. They currently still refer to the IMA and EVM subsystems
as development-only, but they are available in the stable kernels now.
Especially the default policy that is available in the kernel is pretty
useful. When you want to consider custom policies (for instance with
SELinux integration) you'll need a kernel patch that is already
upstreamed but not applied to the stable kernels yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support IMA/EVM, a package called ima-evm-utils is available in the
hardened-dev overlay, which will be moved to the main tree soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, the PaX documentation has seen quite a lot of
updates. Other documents that have seen updates are the Hardened FAQ,
Integrity subproject and SELinux documentation although most of them
were small changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion given is to clean up the Hardened project page;
however, there has been some talk within Gentoo to move project pages to
the Gentoo wiki. Such a move might make the suggestion easier to handle.
And while on the subject of the wiki, we might want to move user guides
to the wiki already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bugs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug &lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/443630"&gt;443630&lt;/a&gt; refers to segmentation
faults with libvirt when starting Qemu domains on a SELinux-enabled
host. Sadly, I'm not able to test libvirt myself so either someone with
SELinux and libvirt&lt;br&gt;
expertise can chime in, or we will need to troubleshoot it by bug
(using gdb, strace'ing more, ...) which might take quite some time and
is not user friendly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various talks where held at FOSDEM regarding Gentoo Hardened, and a lot
of people attended those talks. Also the round table was quite
effective, with many users interacting with developers all around. For
next year, chances are very high that we'll give a "What has changed
since last year" session and a round table again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many thanks to the usual suspects: Zorry, blueness, prometheanfire,
lejonet, klondike and the several dozen contributors that are going to
kill me for not mentioning their (nick)names.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="grsecurity"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="kernel"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="minutes"></category><category term="online"></category><category term="pax"></category><category term="profiles"></category><category term="selinux"></category></entry></feed>
