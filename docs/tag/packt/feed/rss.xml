Administration" has been released by Packt Publishing. This is already the
third edition of the book, after the first (2013) and second (2016) editions
have gotten reasonable success given the technical and often hard nature of
full SELinux administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like with the previous editions, this book remains true to the public of
system administrators, rather than SELinux policy developers. Of course,
SELinux policy development is not ignored in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

past half year (haven't you noticed? my blog was quite silent) has come to an
end: the &lt;a href="https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/selinux-system-administration-second-edition"&gt;SELinux System Administration - Second Edition&lt;/a&gt;
book is now available. With almost double the amount of pages and a serious
update of the content, the book can now be bought either through Packt Publishing
itself, or the various online bookstores such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SELinux-System-Administration-Sven-Vermeulen-ebook/dp/B01LWM02WI"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the holidays now approaching, I hope to be able to execute a few tasks
within the Gentoo community (and of the Gentoo Foundation) and get back on track.
Luckily, my absence was not jeopardizing the state of &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux"&gt;SELinux&lt;/a&gt;
in Gentoo thanks to the efforts of Jason Zaman.&lt;/p&gt;
