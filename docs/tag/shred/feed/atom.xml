&lt;p&gt;In Gentoo, you can find the package as part of &lt;code&gt;app-admin/testdisk&lt;/code&gt;. To
recover the files, I ran the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ photorec /log /d /path/to/recovery/dest /dev/sdc1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While skimming through the recovered files, I found a few ones that I
deleted a long time ago but apparently never got overwritten (the data,
that is). Scary to see how easy such recovery is... Makes me remember
that, if you really want to delete files in a less recoverable manner,
you can use &lt;strong&gt;shred&lt;/strong&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those out there yelling to backup this data - you're absolutely
correct, but no. I backup my systems and important files daily, but this
disk contained (mainly) raw picture images and videorecordings. The
manipulated, finished images and recordings are backed up (or at least
on a disk &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; somewhere online), but the raw images and recordings are
often too much to introduce a backup for, and if I would really lost
them, I wouldn't shed a tear (nor panic).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Free Software"></category><category term="corruption"></category><category term="photorec"></category><category term="recovery"></category><category term="shred"></category></entry></feed>
