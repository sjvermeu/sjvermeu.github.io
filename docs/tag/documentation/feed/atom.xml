noticed a lot of updates and edits on the Gentoo wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Website/Tyrian"&gt;Tyrian&lt;/a&gt; layout,
whose purpose is to eventually become the unified layout for all Gentoo
resources, happened first. Then, three common templates (&lt;code&gt;Code&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;Kernel&lt;/code&gt;) where deprecated in favor of their "*Box" counterparts
(&lt;code&gt;CodeBox&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FileBox&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KernelBox&lt;/code&gt;). These provide better parameter
support (which should make future updates on the templates easier to
implement) as well as syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the wiki also saw a number of contributions being added. I added a
short article on &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Efibootmgr"&gt;Efibootmgr&lt;/a&gt;
as the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page"&gt;Gentoo
handbook&lt;/a&gt; now also uses
it for its EFI related instructions, but other users added quite a few
additional articles as well. As they come along, articles are being
marked by editors for translation. For me, that's a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a wiki article is marked for translations, it shows up on the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Special:PageTranslation"&gt;PageTranslation&lt;/a&gt;
list. When I have time, I pick one of these articles and try to update
it to move to a common style (the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki:Guidelines"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; page
is the "official" one, and I have a
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:SwifT/Styleguide"&gt;Styleguide&lt;/a&gt; in
which I elaborate a bit more on the use). Having a common style gives a
better look and feel to the articles (as they are then more alike),
gives a common documentation development approach (so everyone can join
in and update documentation in a similar layout/structure) and - most
importantly - reduces the number of edits that do little more than
switch from one formatting to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an article has been edited, I mark it for translation, and then the
real workhorse on the wiki starts. We have several active translators on
the Gentoo wiki, who we cannot thank hard enough for their work (I used
to start at Gentoo as a translator, I have some feeling about their
work). They make the Gentoo documentation reachable for a broader
audience. Thanks to the use of the translation extension (kindly offered
by the Gentoo wiki admins, who have been working quite hard the last few
weeks on improving the wiki infrastructure) translations are easier to
handle and follow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of a translation-marked article is that any change on the
article also shows up on the list again, allowing me to look at the
change and perform edits when necessary. For the end user, this is
behind the scenes - an update on an article shows up immediately, which
is fine. But for me (and perhaps other editors as well) this gives a
nice overview of changes to articles (watchlists can only go so far) and
also shows the changes in a simple yet efficient manner. Thanks to this
approach, we can more actively follow up on edits and improve where
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, editing is not always just a few minutes of work. Consider the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GRUB2"&gt;GRUB2&lt;/a&gt; article on the wiki. It was
marked for translation, but had some issues with its style. It was very
verbose (which is not a bad thing, but suggests to split information
towards multiple articles) and quite a few open discussions on its
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Talk:GRUB2"&gt;Discussions&lt;/a&gt; page. I started
editing the article around 13.12h local time, and ended at 19.40h.
Unlike with offline documentation, the entire process of the editing can
be followed through the page'
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/index.php?title=GRUB2&amp;amp;offset=&amp;amp;limit=100&amp;amp;action=history"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;).
And although I'm still not 100% satisfied with the result, it is imo
easier to follow through and read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, don't get me wrong - I do not feel that the article was wrong
in any way. Although I would appreciate articles that immediately follow
a style, I rather see more contributions (which we can then edit towards
the new style) than that we would start penalizing contributors that
don't use the style. That would work contra-productive, because it is
far easier to update the style of an article than to write articles. We
should try and get more contributors to document aspects of their Gentoo
journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, please keep them coming. If you find a lack of (good) information
for something, start jotting down what you know in an article. We'll
gladly help you out with editing and improving the article then, but the
content is something you are probably best to write down.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Documentation"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="wiki"></category></entry><entry><title>Revamped our SELinux documentation</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2014/05/revamped-our-selinux-documentation/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-12T22:15:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-05-12T22:15:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2014-05-12:/2014/05/revamped-our-selinux-documentation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the move to the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo wiki&lt;/a&gt;, I have

&lt;p&gt;We start with a new &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Quick_introduction"&gt;introduction to
SELinux&lt;/a&gt;
article which goes over a large set of SELinux' features and concepts.
Next, we cover the various concepts within SELinux. This is mostly
SELinux features but explained more in-depth. Then we go on to the user
guides. We start of course with the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Installation"&gt;installation of SELinux on
Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; and then
cover the remainder of administrative topics within SELinux (user
management, handling AVC denials, label management, booleans, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is most likely sufficient for the majority of SELinux users. A
few more expert-specific documents are provided as well (some of them
still work in progress, but I didn't want to wait to get some feedback)
and there is also a section specific for (Gentoo) developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part on "Preparing the Disks" saw the most changes. It starts with
explaining the differences between the two layouts with advantages and
disadvantages. It then helps the user decide what layout is best for him
(or her).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt; (and let me stress that one out again, because
many people have reported bugs on it: it is an &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt;) partition
layout now includes a BIOS boot partition in the beginning, 2 MB in
size. This is to support GRUB2 on GPT, but doesn't hurt for GRUB2 with
the MSDOS-style layout either. That means that the partition numbers now
move up one (the &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt; /boot is now at sda2, the swap at sda3 and
root on sda4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partitioning instructions now also include the proper alignment
instructions (using MB alignment), and use parted as the default
partitioning method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are submitted to CVS so will show up on the Gentoo site in
an hour or so (documentation on the sites is synchronized hourly if I'm
not mistaken). Please do give it a good read and report bugs on
&lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org"&gt;bugs.gentoo.org&lt;/a&gt;. You might also want to ping
me on IRC if it is urgent, although no guarantees that I'm behind my

documents&lt;/a&gt;
that have been moved, or have seen enough development on the wiki that
they are deemed of proper quality and stable (not too many changes
left). Currently, such documents are (requested to be) marked for
translation, allowing me or other developers to review if the guides are
indeed ok to move forward. If so, they are marked as translatable
(allowing the various translation members on the wiki to move forward
with translating the guides) and will be made part of the overview as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few documents that has not been moved yet is the Gentoo
Handbook as it is of a different format than the guides, and includes
dynamic documentation generation features which I have yet to fully
investigate (wiki-wise). I currently focused mainly on the non-handbook
guides, so the handbook itself will get more attention later (after the
documentation overview is completed).&lt;/p&gt;

GuideXML into wiki style content, although manual corrections remain
needed. For instance, all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre caption="..."&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; stuff is changed into

because the SELinux usage at the firm I work at is most likely going to
grow as well, I decided to join the bunch of documents on SELinux that
are "out there" and start a series of my own. After all, too much
documentation probably doesn't hurt, and SELinux definitely deserves a
lot of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for this
endeavour instead of a GuideXML approach (which is the format used for
Gentoo documentation on the main site). The set of tutorials that I
already wrote can be found under the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux"&gt;SELinux&lt;/a&gt; : &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Tutorials"&gt;Gentoo Hardened
SELinux Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;
location. Although of course meant to support the Gentoo Hardened
SELinux users, I'm hoping to keep the initial set of tutorial articles
deliberately distribution-independent so I can refer to them at work as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now (this is a week's work, so don't expect this amount of tutorials
to double in the next few days) I wrote about the security context of a
process, how SELinux controls file and directory accesses, where to find
SELinux permission denial details, controlling file contexts yourself
and how a process gets into a certain context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I can keep the articles in good shape and with a gradual step-up
in complexity. That does mean that most articles are not complete (for
instance, when talking about domain transitions, I don't talk about
constraints that might prohibit them, or about the role and type
mismatches (invalid context) that you might get, etc.) and that those
details will follow in later articles. Hopefully that allows users to
learn step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each tutorial, you will find a "What you need to remember"
section. This is a very short overview of what was said in the tutorial
and that you will need to know in future articles. If you ever read a
tutorial article, then this section might be sufficient for you to
remember again what it was about - no need to reread the entire article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider it an attempt at a &lt;code&gt;tl;dr&lt;/code&gt; for articles ;-) Enjoy your reading,
and if you have any remarks, don't hesitate to contribute on the wiki or
talk through the "Talk" pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="SELinux"></category><category term="articles"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="tutorials"></category><category term="wiki"></category></entry></feed>
