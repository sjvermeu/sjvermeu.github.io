are. They are a means to visualize information, ideas or tasks in
whatever structure you like. By using graphical annotations the
information is easier to look through, even when the mindmap becomes
very large. In the commercial world, mindmapping software such as
&lt;a href="http://www.xmind.net/"&gt;XMind&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.mindjet.com/products/mindmanager/"&gt;Mindmanager&lt;/a&gt; are often
used. But these companies should really start looking into Freemind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;Freemind&lt;/a&gt;
software is a java-based mind map software, running perfectly on
Windows, Linux or other platforms. Installation is a breeze (if you are
allowed to on your work, you can just launch it from a USB drive if you
want, so no installation hassles whatsoever) and its interface is very
intuitive. For all the whistles and bells that the commercial ones
provide, I just want to create my mindmaps and export them into a format
that others can easily use and view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my real-time job, we (have to) use XMind. If someone shares a mindmap
("their mind" map as I often see it - I seem to have a different mind
than most others in how I structure things, except for one colleague who
imo does not structure things at all) they just share the XMind file and
hope that the recipients can read it. Although XMind can export mindmaps
just fine, I do like the freemind approach where a simple java applet
can show the entire mindmap as interactively as you would navigate
through the application itself. This makes it perfect for discussing
ideas because you can close and open branches easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Import_and_export"&gt;export/import&lt;/a&gt;
capabilities of freemind are also interesting. Before being forced to
use XMind, we were using Mindmanager and I could just easily import the
mindmaps into freemind. The file format that freemind uses is an
XML-based one, so translating those onto other formats is not that
difficult if you know some XSLT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally use freemind when I embark on a new project, to structure
the approach, centralize all information, keep track of problems (and
their solutions), etc. The only thing I am missing is a nice interface
for mobile devices though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="freemind"></category><category term="java"></category><category term="mab"></category><category term="mindmanager"></category><category term="mindmap"></category><category term="structure"></category><category term="xmind"></category></entry><entry><title>Hacking java bytecode with dhex</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/06/hacking-java-bytecode-with-dhex/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-01T03:50:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-06-01T03:50:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-06-01:/2013/06/hacking-java-bytecode-with-dhex/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found myself in a weird situation: a long long time ago, I wrote a

java application that I didn't touch nor ran for a few years. Today, I
found it on a backup and wanted to run it again (its a graphical
application for generating HTML pages). However, it failed in a
particular feature. Not with an exception or stack trace, just
functionally. Now, I have the source code at hand, so I look into the
code and find the logical error. Below is a snippet of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;if (myHandler != null) {
  int i = startValue + maxRange;
  for (int j = endValue; j &amp;gt; i; j--) {
    ... (do some logic)
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter what the code is supposed to do, but from what I can
remember, I shouldn't be adding &lt;code&gt;maxRange&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; variable (yet - as
I do that later in the code). But instead of setting up the java
development environment, emerging the IDE etc. I decided to just edit
the class file directly using &lt;strong&gt;dhex&lt;/strong&gt; (a wonderful utility I recently
discovered) because doing things the hard way is sometimes fun as well.
So I ran &lt;strong&gt;javap -c MyClass&lt;/strong&gt; to get some java bytecode information from
the method, which gives me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   8:   ifnull  116
   11:  iload_2
   12:  iload_3
   13:  iadd
   14:  istore  5
   16:  iload_2
   17:  istore  6
   19:  iload   6
   21:  iload   5
   23:  if_icmpge       106
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know lines 11 and 12 is about pushing the 2nd and 3rd arguments of the
function (which are &lt;code&gt;startValue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maxRange&lt;/code&gt;) to the stack to add
them (line 13). To remove the third argument, I can change this opcode
from &lt;code&gt;1d&lt;/code&gt; (iload_3) to &lt;code&gt;03&lt;/code&gt; (iconst_0). This way, zero is added and
the code itself just continues as needed. And for some reason, that
seems to be the only mistake I made then because the application now
works flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacking is fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="bytecode"></category><category term="dhex"></category><category term="java"></category></entry></feed>
