Hardened&lt;/a&gt;, so it's time for

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolchain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC 4.8.1 will be out soon, although nothing major has occurred with it
since the last meeting. There is a plugin header install problem in 4.8
and its not certain that the (trivial) fix is in 4.8.1, but it certainly
is inside Gentoo's release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueness is also (still, and hopefully for a long time ;-) maintaining
the uclibc hardened related toolchain aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel and grSecurity/PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further progress on the XATTR_PAX migration was put on a lower
level the past few weeks due to busy, busy... very busy weeks (but this
was announced and known in advance). We still need to do XATTR copying
in &lt;em&gt;install&lt;/em&gt; for packages that do pax markings before &lt;em&gt;src_install()&lt;/em&gt;
and include the &lt;code&gt;user.pax&lt;/code&gt; XATTR patch in the gentoo-sources kernel.
This will silence the errors for non-hardened users and fix the loss of
XATTR markings for those packages that do pax-mark before install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set then needs to be documented further and tested on vanilla and
hardened systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zorry asked if a separate script can be provided for those ebuilds that
directly call &lt;strong&gt;paxctl&lt;/strong&gt;. These ebuilds might want to switch to the
eclass, but if they need to call &lt;strong&gt;paxctl&lt;/strong&gt; or similar directly (for
instance because the result is immediately used for further building), a
separate script or tool should be made available. Blueness will look
into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;code&gt;hardened-sources&lt;/code&gt;, we are now with stable 2.6.32-r160, 3.2.42-r1 and
3.8.6 due to some vulnerabilities in earlier versions (in networking
code). There is still some bug (nfs-related) that is fixed in 3.2.44 so
that part might need a bump as well soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href="http://blog.siphos.be/2013/04/introducing-selocal-for-small-selinux-policy-enhancements/"&gt;selocal&lt;/a&gt;
command is now available for Gentoo SELinux users, allowing them to
easily enhance the policy without having to maintain their own SELinux
policy modules (the script is a wrapper that does all that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setools package now also uses the &lt;a href="http://blog.siphos.be/2013/04/sloting-the-old-swig-1/"&gt;SLOT'ed
swig&lt;/a&gt;, so no more
dependency breakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On SELinux userspace and policy, both have seen a new release last
month, and both are already in the Gentoo portage tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SELinux policy ebuilds now also call
&lt;a href="http://blog.siphos.be/2013/05/overriding-the-default-selinux-policies/"&gt;epatch_user&lt;/a&gt;
so users can customize the policies even further without having to copy
ebuilds to their overlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;strong&gt;tar&lt;/strong&gt; supports XATTR well, we might want to look into SELinux
stages again. Jmbsvicetto did some work on that, but the builds failed
during stage1. We'll look into that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing much to say, we're waiting a bit until the patches proposed by
the IMA team are merged in the main kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two no-multilib fixes have been applied to the
&lt;code&gt;hardened/amd64/no-multilib&lt;/code&gt; profiles. One was a QA issue and quickly
resolved, the other is due to the profile stacking within Gentoo
profiles, where we missed a profile and thus were missing a few masks
defined in that (missed) profile. But including the profile creates a
lot of duplicates again, so we are going to copy the masks across until
the duplicates are resolved in the other profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueness will also clean up the experimental &lt;code&gt;13.0&lt;/code&gt; directory since all
hardened profiles now follow 13.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest changes on SELinux have been added to the Gentoo SELinux
handbook. Also, I've been slowly (but surely) adding topics to the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Tutorials"&gt;SELinux tutorials
listing&lt;/a&gt; on the Gentoo
wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grSecurity 2 document is very much out of date, blueness hopes to
put some time in fixing that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's about it for the short write-up. Zorry will surely post the
log later on the appropriate channels. Good work done (again) by all
team members!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="irc"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="monthly"></category><category term="online"></category></entry></feed>
