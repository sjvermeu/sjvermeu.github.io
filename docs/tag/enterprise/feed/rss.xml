active within the enterprise world. Even if a company only wants to use
commercially backed solutions, many - if not most - of these are built with, and
are using open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, open source is more than just a code sourcing possibility. By having a
good statement within the company on how it wants to deal with open source, what
it wants to support, etc. engineers and developers can have a better
understanding of what they can do to support their business further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, companies will draft up an &lt;em&gt;open source policy&lt;/em&gt;, and in this post
I want to share some practices I've learned on how to draft such a policy.&lt;/p&gt;

approach security and security-conscious architecturing. But while there are
principles within the zero trust mindset that came up in the last dozen years,
most of the content in zero trust discussions is tied to age-old security
propositions.&lt;/p&gt;
