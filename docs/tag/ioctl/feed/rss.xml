In the past, this was only possible in monolithic ones (and CIL). Through this, allow rules can be extended to not only cover source (domain) and target (resource) identifiers, but also a specific number on which it applies. And ioctl's are the first (and currently only) permission on which this is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that ioctl-level permission controls isn't a new feature by itself, but the fact that it can be used in modular policies is.&lt;/p&gt;
