year&lt;/em&gt; list: put a new android
(&lt;a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/"&gt;Cyanogenmod&lt;/a&gt;) on my tablet, which was
still running the stock Android - but hasn't seen any updates in more
than a year. Considering the (in)security of Android this was long
overdue for me. But the fear of getting an unbootable tablet ("bricked"
as it is often called) was keeping me from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I finally got the nerves, I first had to run around screaming
for hours because the first step in the instructions didn't work. The
next day I read that it might have to do with the cable - and indeed,
tried with a different cable and the instructions just went along just
fine. So today I'm happily running with a more up-to-date Android again
on my tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because my systems run Gentoo Hardened with SELinux, I did had to do
some small magic tricks to get the
&lt;a href="http://www.clockworkmod.com/"&gt;Clockworkmod&lt;/a&gt; recovery on the tablet: the
&lt;strong&gt;wheelie&lt;/strong&gt; binary (yes, I couldn't find the sources - if they are even
available) that I had to run required me to disable size overflow
detection in the kernel (a PaX countermeasure), allowed executable
memory (both through &lt;strong&gt;paxctl-ng&lt;/strong&gt; as well as in SELinux using the
&lt;code&gt;allow_execmem&lt;/code&gt; boolean) and had to temporarily add in the
&lt;code&gt;dev_rw_generic_usb_dev&lt;/code&gt; right (refpolicy macro) to my user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;strong&gt;adb&lt;/strong&gt; had to be pax-marked, although I now know I don't need
&lt;strong&gt;adb&lt;/strong&gt; at all - I can just download the latest Android ZIP file from
the phone itself and refer to it from the recovery manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all nothing to worry about - everything worked like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; (so I remember next time), if the system is stuck in CMR
(recovery), reboot with VolDown+Pwr, but don't select recovery. After 5
seconds, it will ask if you want a cold boot. Select it, and things work
again ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category><category term="grsecurity"></category><category term="pax"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="tablet"></category></entry><entry><title>And now, 31 days later...</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/08/and-now-31-days-later/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-01T22:43:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-01T22:43:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-08-01:/2013/08/and-now-31-days-later/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;... the &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened"&gt;Gentoo Hardened&lt;/a&gt; team

had its monthly online meeting again ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the agenda were the usual suspects, such as the &lt;em&gt;toolchain&lt;/em&gt;. In this
category, Zorry mentioned that he has a fix for GCC 4.8.1 for the
&lt;code&gt;hardenedno*&lt;/code&gt; and vanilla &lt;code&gt;gcc-config&lt;/code&gt; options which will be added to
the tree after some more testing. The problem is that with GCC 4.8,
certain settings need to be set sooner than before (in the code path),
which is what the fix focuses on. The ASAN issue is still unresolved,
but otherwise GCC 4.8 is working fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;, the policycoreutils package has been bumped to include
support for &lt;code&gt;mcstrans&lt;/code&gt;, a translation daemon that visualizes humanly
readable strings instead of the standard sensitivity/category sets in
case of MCS/MLS policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding documentation, the wiki team (most notably a3li) is working
hard to support project pages on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo
Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Once we can, we will be moving our
project page with all related documentation to the wiki, allowing for
easier documentation development and a more modern look. To support
this, an XML-to-wiki stylesheet is available that translates ProjectXML
and GuideXML to the wiki language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, we also mentioned the stabilization policy (or at
least, no-longer-stabilization) of the vanilla sources (plain kernel.org
Linux kernel sources). This doesn't immediately effect the hardened
project, but is important to know nonetheless, especially for users of
hardened technologies that are in the main kernel already (like SELinux
or IMA/EVM) as they have to be aware to either use the latest
(regardless of the keywords in use) or switch to gentoo-sources or
(preferably) hardened-sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For uclibc support, the stages will be provided every 2 months rather
than every month as this is a resource-intensive process that isn't
fully automated yet (except for amd64 and x86 which are automated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on PaX and grSecurity support, the XATTR patch for tmpfs is now
in the kernel, and the problem about loosing PaX markings during
installation is fixed as Portage (2.1.12.9 and higher) now preserves the
flags during installation (a wrapper on &lt;code&gt;install&lt;/code&gt; is used that preserves
&lt;code&gt;usr.pax.flags&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="grsecurity"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="irc"></category><category term="irl"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="minutes"></category><category term="pax"></category><category term="project"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="toolchain"></category></entry><entry><title>Looking at the local Linux kernel privilege escalation</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/05/looking-at-the-local-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-17T03:50:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-05-17T03:50:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-05-17:/2013/05/looking-at-the-local-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been a few posts already on the local Linux kernel privilege

&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1eb9iw/sdfucksheeporgs_semtexc_local_linux_root_exploit/c9ykrck"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;
that Brad Spengler made on the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the vulnerability is an &lt;em&gt;out-of-bound&lt;/em&gt; access to an array
within the Linux perf code (which is a performance measuring subsystem
enabled when &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS&lt;/code&gt; is enabled). This subsystem is often
enabled as it offers a wide range of performance measurement techniques
(see &lt;a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;its wiki&lt;/a&gt; for
more information). You can check on your own system through the kernel
configuration (&lt;strong&gt;zgrep CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS /proc/config.gz&lt;/strong&gt; if you
have the latter pseudo-file available - it is made available through
&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public exploit maps memory in userland, fills it with known data,
then triggers an out-of-bound decrement that tricks the kernel into
decrementing this data (mapped in userland). By looking at where the
decrement occurred, the exploit now knows the base address of the array.
Next, it targets (through the same vulnerability) the IDT base
(Interrupt Descriptor Table) and targets the overflow interrupt vector.
It increments the top part of the address that the vector points to
(which is 0xffffffff, becoming 0x00000000 thus pointing to the
userland), maps this memory region itself with shellcode, and then
triggers the overflow. The shell code used in the public exploit
modifies the credentials of the current task, sets uid/gid with root and
gives full capabilities, and then executes a shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Brad mentions, &lt;a href="https://grsecurity.net/~spender/uderef.txt"&gt;UDEREF&lt;/a&gt;
(an option in a grSecurity enabled kernel) should mitigate the attempt
to get to the userland. On my system, the exploit fails with the
following (start of) oops (without affecting the system further) when it
tries to close the file descriptor returned from the syscall that
invokes the decrement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[ 1926.226678] PAX: please report this to pageexec@freemail.hu

&lt;p&gt;The exploit also finds that the decrement didn't succeed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;test: semtex.c:76: main: Assertion &amp;#39;i&amp;lt;0x0100000000/4&amp;#39; failed.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A second mitigation is that
&lt;a href="http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/PaXTeam-H2HC12-PaX-kernel-self-protection.pdf"&gt;KERNEXEC&lt;/a&gt;
(also offered through grSecurity) which prevents the kernel from
executing data that is writable (including userland data). So modifying
the IDT would be mitigated as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important mitigation is TPE - &lt;em&gt;Trusted Path Execution&lt;/em&gt;. This
feature prevents the execution of binaries that are not located in a
root-owned directory and owned by a trusted group (which on my system is
10 = wheel). So users attempting to execute such code will fail with a
&lt;em&gt;Permission denied&lt;/em&gt; error, and the following is shown in the logs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[ 3152.165780] grsec: denied untrusted exec (due to not being in trusted group and file in non-root-owned directory) of /home/user/test by /home/user/test[bash:4382] uid/euid:1000/1000 gid/egid:100/100, parent /bin/bash[bash:4352] uid/euid:1000/1000 gid/egid:100/100
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, even though a nicely hardened system should be fairly immune
against the currently circling public exploit, it should be noted that
it is not immune against the vulnerability itself. The methods above
mentioned make it so that that particular way of gaining root access is
not possible, but it still allows an attacker to decrement and increment
memory in specific locations so other exploits might be found to modify
the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now out-of-bound vulnerabilities are not new. Recently (february this
year), a
&lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=MTMxMTg"&gt;vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;
in the networking code also provided an attack vector to get a local
privilege escalation. A mandatory access control system like SELinux has
little impact on such vulnerabilities if you allow users to execute
their own code. Even confined users can modify the exploit to disable
SELinux (since the shell code is ran with ring0 privileges it can access
and modify the SELinux state information in the kernel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 4.8 of GCC is available in the tree, but currently masked. The
package contains a fix needed to build hardened-sources, and a fix for
the asan (address sanitizer).
&lt;a href="http://www.internetnews.com/blog/skerner/open-source-gcc-4.8-compiler-including-address-sanitizer-security.html"&gt;asan&lt;/a&gt;
support in GCC 4.8 might be seen as an improvement security-wise, but it
is yet unclear if it is an integral part of GCC or could be disabled
with a configure flag. Apparently, asan "makes building gcc 4.8 crazy".
Seeing that it comes from Google, and building Google Chromium is also
crazy, I start seeing a pattern here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turns out that PaX/grSec and asan do not get along yet (ASAN
assumes/uses hardcoded userland address space size values, which breaks
when UDEREF is set as it pitches a bit from the size):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ERROR: AddressSanitizer failed to allocate 0x20000001000 (2199023259648) bytes at address 0x0ffffffff000
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Given that this is hardcoded in the resulting binaries, it isn't
sufficient to change the size value from 47 bits to 46 bits as hardened
systems can very well boot a kernel with and another kernel without
UDEREF, causing the binaries to fail on the other kernel. Instead, a
proper method would be to dynamically check the size of a userland
address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, GCC 4.8 also brings along some nice enhancements and features.
uclibc profiles work just fine with GCC 4.8, including armv7a and
mips/mipsel. The latter is especially nice to hear, since mips used to
require significant effort with previous GCCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel and grSecurity/PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recent kernels have now been stabilized to stay close to the
grSecurity/PaX upstream developments. The most recent stable kernel now
is hardened-sources-3.8.3. Others still available are hardened-sources
versions 3.2.40-r1 and 2.6.32-r156.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support for XATTR_PAX is still progressing, but a few issues have
come up. One is that non-hardened systems are seeing warnings about
&lt;strong&gt;pax-mark&lt;/strong&gt; not being able to set the XATTR_PAX on tmpfs since vanilla
kernels do not have the patch to support &lt;code&gt;user.*&lt;/code&gt; extended attribute
namespaces for tmpfs. A second issue is that the &lt;strong&gt;install&lt;/strong&gt;
application, as provided by &lt;code&gt;coreutils&lt;/code&gt;, does not copy extended
attributes. This has impact on ebuilds where pax markings are done
before the install phase of a package. But only doing pax markings after
the install phase isn't sufficient either, since sometimes we need the
binaries to be marked already for test phases or even in the compile
phase. So this is still something on the near horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely the necessary tools will be patched to include extended
attributes on copy operations. However, we need to take care only to
copy over those attributes that make sense: &lt;code&gt;user.pax&lt;/code&gt; does, but
security ones like &lt;code&gt;security.evm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;security.selinux&lt;/code&gt; shouldn't as
those are either recomputed when needed, or governed through policy. The
idea is that USE="pax_kernel" will enable the above on &lt;code&gt;coreutils&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SELinux support in Gentoo has seen a fair share of updates on the
userland utilities (like policycoreutils, setools, libselinux and such).
Most of these have already made the stable tree or are close to be
bumped to stable. The SELinux policy also has been updated a lot: most
changes can be tracked through bugzilla, looking for the
&lt;code&gt;sec-policy r13&lt;/code&gt; whiteboard. The changes can be applied to the system
immediately if you use the live ebuilds (like &lt;code&gt;selinux-base-9999&lt;/code&gt;), but
I'm planning on releasing revision 13 of our policy set soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;System Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the "early adopter" problems we've noticed on Gentoo Hardened
have been integrated in the repositories upstream and are slowly
progressing towards the main Linux kernel tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All hardened profiles have been moved to the 13.0 base. Some people
frowned when they noticed that the uclibc profiles do not inherit from
any architecture-related profile. This is however with reason: the
architecture profiles are (amongst other reasons) focusing on the glibc
specifics of the architecture. Since the profile intended here is for
uclibc, those changes are not needed (nor wanted). Hence, these are
collapsed in a single profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For SELinux, the &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/selinux/selinux-handbook.xml"&gt;SELinux
handbook&lt;/a&gt;
now includes information about USE="unconfined" as well as the
&lt;code&gt;selinux_gentoo&lt;/code&gt; init script as provided by &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils&lt;/code&gt;. Users who
are already running with SELinux enabled can just look at the &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/selinux/selinux-handbook.xml?part=2&amp;amp;chap=7"&gt;Change
History&lt;/a&gt;
to see which changes affect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Tutorials"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;
(which I've blogged about earlier as well) have been put online at the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Next to the SELinux tutorials,
an article pertaining to &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/AIDE"&gt;AIDE&lt;/a&gt; has
been added as well as it fits nicely within the principles/concepts of
the &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/integrity/index.xml"&gt;System

arm has been added (SPEC updates) and the remainder of architectures
will be added by the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kernel and grSecurity/PaX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernel 3.7.5 had a security issue (local root privilege escalation) so
3.7.5-r1 which held a fix for this was stabilized quickly. However,
other (non-security) problems have been reported, such as one with
dovecot, regarding the VSIZE memory size. This should be fixed in the
3.8 series, so these are candidate for a faster stabilization. This
faster stabilization is never fun, as it increases the likelihood that
we miss other things, but they are needed as the vulnerability in the
previous stable kernel was too severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding XATTR_PAX, we are getting pretty close to the migration. The
eclass is ready and will be announced for review on the appropriate
mailinglists later this week. A small problem still remains on
Paludis-using systems (Paludis does not record NEEDED.ELF.2 information
- linkage information - so it is hard to get all the linkage information
on a system). A different revdep-pax and migrate-pax toolset will be
built that detects the necessary linkage information, but much slower
than on a Portage-running system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SELinux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11th revision of the policies are now stable, and work is on the way
for the 12th revision which will hit the tree soon. Some work is on the
way for setools and policycoreutils (one due to a new release - setools
- and the other one due to a build failure if PAM is not set). Both
packages will hit the hardened-dev overlay soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new "edition" of the selinuxnode virtual image has been pushed to the
mirror system, providing a SELinux-enabled (enforcing) Gentoo Hardened
system with grSecurity and PaX, as well as IMA and EVM enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 13.0 profiles have been running fine for a while at a few of our
developer systems. No changes have been needed (yet) so things are
looking good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Integrity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The necessary userland utilities have been moved to the main tree. The
documentation for IMA/EVM has been updated as well to reflec the current
state of IMA/EVM within Gentoo Hardened. IMA, even with the custom
policies, seems to be working well. EVM on the other hand has some
issues, so you might need to run with EVM=fix for now. Debugging on this
issue is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the user oriented documentation (integrity and SELinux) have
been moved to the Gentoo Wiki for easier user contributions and
simplified management. Other documents will follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="grsecurity"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="kernel"></category><category term="pax"></category><category term="profiles"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="toolchain"></category></entry><entry><title>Gentoo Hardened goes onward (aka project meeting)</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/02/gentoo-hardened-goes-onward-aka-project-meeting/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-07T23:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-02-07T23:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-02-07:/2013/02/gentoo-hardened-goes-onward-aka-project-meeting/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been a while again, so time for another Gentoo Hardened online

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolchain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC 4.8 is on development stage 4, so the hardened patches will be
worked on next week. Some help on it is needed to test the patches on
ARM, PPC and MIPS though. For those interested, keep a close eye on the
hardened-dev overlay as those will contain the latest fixes. When GCC
4.9 starts development phase 1, Zorry will again try to upstream the
patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the coming fixes, we might probably (need to) remove the various
hardenedno* GCC profiles from the hardened Gentoo profiles. This
shouldn't impact too many users as ebuilds add in the correct flags
anyhow (for instance when needing to turn off PIE/PIC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel, grSecurity and PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel release 3.7.0 that we have stable in our tree has seen a few
setbacks, but no higher version is stable yet (mainly due to the
stabilization period needed). 3.7.4-r1 and 3.7.5 are prime candidates
with good track record,&lt;br&gt;
so we might be stabilizing 3.7.5 in the very near future (next week
probably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the PaX flag migration (you know, from ELF-header based marking to
extended attributes marking), the documentation has seen its necessary
upgrades and the userland utilities have been updated to reflect the use
of xattr markings. The eclass we use for the markings will use the
correct utility based on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue faced when trying to support both markings is that some
actions (like the "paxctl -Cc" which creates the PT_PAX header if it is
missing) make no sense with the other (as there is no header when using
XATTR_PAX). The eclass will be updated to ignore these flags when
XATTR_PAX is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision 10 is stable in the tree, and revision 11 is waiting
stabilization period. A few more changes have been put in the policy
repository already (which are installed when using the live ebuilds) and
will of course be part of&lt;br&gt;
revision 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change in the userland utilities was also pushed out to allow
permissive domains (so run a single domain in permissive mode instead of
the entire system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SELinux eclass has been updated to remove SELinux modules
from all defined SELinux module stores if the SELinux policy package is
removed from the system. Before that, the user had to remove the modules
from the store himself manually, but this is error-prone and easily
forgotten, especially for the non-default SELinux policy stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All hardened subprofiles are marked as deprecated now (you've seen the
discussions on this on the mailinglist probably on this) so we now have
a sane set of hardened profiles to manage. The subprofiles were used for
things like&lt;br&gt;
"desktop" or "server", whereas users can easily stack their profiles as
they see fit anyhow - so there was little reason for the project to
continue managing those subprofiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, now that Gentoo has released its 13.0 profile, we will need to
migrate our profiles to the 13.0 ones as well. So, the idea is to
temporarily support 13.0 in a subprofile, test it thoroughly, and then
remove the subprofile and switch the main one to 13.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;System Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for IMA and EVM is available on the Gentoo Hardened
project site. They currently still refer to the IMA and EVM subsystems
as development-only, but they are available in the stable kernels now.
Especially the default policy that is available in the kernel is pretty
useful. When you want to consider custom policies (for instance with
SELinux integration) you'll need a kernel patch that is already
upstreamed but not applied to the stable kernels yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support IMA/EVM, a package called ima-evm-utils is available in the
hardened-dev overlay, which will be moved to the main tree soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, the PaX documentation has seen quite a lot of
updates. Other documents that have seen updates are the Hardened FAQ,
Integrity subproject and SELinux documentation although most of them
were small changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion given is to clean up the Hardened project page;
however, there has been some talk within Gentoo to move project pages to
the Gentoo wiki. Such a move might make the suggestion easier to handle.
And while on the subject of the wiki, we might want to move user guides
to the wiki already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bugs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug &lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/443630"&gt;443630&lt;/a&gt; refers to segmentation
faults with libvirt when starting Qemu domains on a SELinux-enabled
host. Sadly, I'm not able to test libvirt myself so either someone with
SELinux and libvirt&lt;br&gt;
expertise can chime in, or we will need to troubleshoot it by bug
(using gdb, strace'ing more, ...) which might take quite some time and
is not user friendly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various talks where held at FOSDEM regarding Gentoo Hardened, and a lot
of people attended those talks. Also the round table was quite
effective, with many users interacting with developers all around. For
next year, chances are very high that we'll give a "What has changed
since last year" session and a round table again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many thanks to the usual suspects: Zorry, blueness, prometheanfire,
lejonet, klondike and the several dozen contributors that are going to
kill me for not mentioning their (nick)names.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="grsecurity"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="kernel"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="minutes"></category><category term="online"></category><category term="pax"></category><category term="profiles"></category><category term="selinux"></category></entry></feed>
