SELinux policies can be a nuisance. Not only are the number of SELinux
policies that are available through the standard repositories limited,
some of these policies are not even written with the same level of
confinement that an administrator might expect. Or perhaps the
technology to be tested is used in a completely different manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without proper policies, any attempt to start such a daemon or
application might or will cause permission violations. In many cases,
developers or users tend to disable SELinux enforcing then so that they
can continue playing with the new technology. And why not? After all,
policy development is to be done &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the technology is understood.&lt;/p&gt;
