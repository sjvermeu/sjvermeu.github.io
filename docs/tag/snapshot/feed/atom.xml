have some issues with too old software and Portage which can't just
upgrade to a recent state. Although many methods exist to work around
it, one that I have found to be very useful is to have access to old
Portage snapshots. It often allows the administrator to upgrade the
system in stages (say in 6-months blocks), perhaps not the entire world
but at least the system set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding old snapshots might be difficult though, so at one point I
decided to create &lt;a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/snapshots/"&gt;a list of old
snapshots&lt;/a&gt;, two months apart,
together with the GPG signature (so people can verify that the snapshot
was not tampered with by me in an attempt to create a Gentoo botnet). I
haven't needed it in a while anymore, but I still try to update the list
every two months, which I just did with the snapshot of January 20th
this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope it at least helps a few other admins out there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="portage"></category><category term="snapshot"></category><category term="tree"></category></entry><entry><title>Upgrading old Gentoo installations</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/12/upgrading-old-gentoo-installations/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-29T14:18:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-12-29T14:18:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-12-29:/2013/12/upgrading-old-gentoo-installations/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I got "pinged" on &lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=463240"&gt;bug

#463240&lt;/a&gt; about the
difficulty of upgrading a Gentoo Linux deployment after a long time of
inactivity on the system. We already have an &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Upgrading_Gentoo"&gt;Upgrading
Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; article on the
Gentoo wiki that describes in great detail how upgrades can be
accomplished. But one of the methods I personally suggest most is to do
small, incremental upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you have a system from early 2009. Not too long ago, but also not
that recent anymore. If you would upgrade that system using the regular
approach, your system would probably be using a non-existing profile
(the &lt;code&gt;/etc/make.profile&lt;/code&gt; symlink would point to a non-existing
location), and if you switch the profile to an existing one, you might
have to deal with problems like the profile requiring certain features
(or EAPI version) that the software currently available on your system
doesn't support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is mentioned in the upgrade guide through the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your Portage is updated before performing any profile
changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it does not tell how to update Portage. In my opinion the best
way forward is to install an older Portage tree snapshot (somewhat more
recent than your own deployment) and upgrade &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; portage, perhaps
also the packages belonging to the &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; set. So for a system that
has not been updated since January 2009, you might want to try the
portage tree snapshot of July 2009, then January 2010, then July 2010,
etc. until you have a recent deployment again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is left for you to do is to find such a snapshot (as the
Portage tree snapshots from the mirrors are cleaned out after a few
months). I try to keep a set of &lt;a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/snapshots/"&gt;Portage tree snapshots
available&lt;/a&gt; with a 2-month
period which should be sufficient for most users to gradually upgrade
their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering I've used this method a few times already I'm going to add
them to the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Upgrading_Gentoo"&gt;upgrading
instructions&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="portage"></category><category term="snapshot"></category><category term="upgrade"></category></entry></feed>
