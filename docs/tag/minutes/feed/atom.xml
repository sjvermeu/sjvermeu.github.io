the various Gentoo Hardened projects. As usual, here is a small
write-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead election&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As every year, we also reviewed the current project leads. No surprises
here, everybody is happy with the current leads so they are re-elected
for another term. We did have two candidates for the lead position, but
even the other candidate vote for Zorry - so we had a unanimous vote ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolchain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC version 4.8.1 will be unmasked pretty soon, and the &lt;code&gt;hardenedno*&lt;/code&gt;
specs on it will work. However, there is still no progress on the asan
(Address Sanitizer) support together with UDEREF. As mentioned in a
previous post, UDEREF "reduces" the address space a bit which doesn't
play well with asan. Still, it isn't inevitable, since PowerPC also has
a reduced address space and so does Windows. So perhaps we can use the
same model for UDEREF enabled kernels? We'll send the suggestion and the
already-existing fixes upstream and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In GCC 4.8.1, the &lt;code&gt;-fstack-check&lt;/code&gt; option might be enabled by default,
but the question is for which architectures and platforms. We know a few
packages, such as &lt;em&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;libav&lt;/em&gt; have problems with it. In those
cases, the ebuild will be modified to use &lt;code&gt;-fno-stack-check&lt;/code&gt; (if
hardened). We opt to enable it for all as we don't really expect much
(if any) breakage that can't be dealt with swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for hardened uClibc is still going steadily. Blueness is heating
his room a bit with it, seeing that mips32r2 takes about 2 weeks to
build hardened and vanilla stages - he is using an Ubiquity router
station for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel and Grsecurity/PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to some boot freezes, as explained in bugs
&lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/482010"&gt;482010&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/481790"&gt;481790&lt;/a&gt;, we don't have a stable 3.10.x
kernel yet. However, most of the issues should be resolved and we're
waiting for confirmation, so we can be looking at a stable 3.10.x kernel
soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3.10 kernel will probably not be a long-term support kernel for PaX
and Grsecurity - such LTS kernel will be picked next year, most likely
the same kernel version that Ubuntu LTS settles on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small update on &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils&lt;/code&gt; has been made that updates &lt;strong&gt;rlpkg&lt;/strong&gt;
and &lt;strong&gt;selocal&lt;/strong&gt;. Other than that, our policies are in nice shape. A new
revision will be pushed to the tree soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Integrity side, recent kernels support custom IMA policies
(again) so our documentation is accurate again. Next to IMA/EVM, I'll be
working on documentation for cryptographically signed kernel module
support soon as well as SCAP-based security baselines for Gentoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueness added a MUSL-based Gentoo profile (&lt;code&gt;hardened/linux/musl&lt;/code&gt;). Musl
is an even more slim libc and its profile is extremely experimental for
now. The profile structure is still a bit off though, a reorganization
will be suggested soon so that the profile inheritance is clear and
predictable, starting off with a non-hardened one
(&lt;code&gt;default/linux/{uclibc,musl}&lt;/code&gt;) and then a hardened specific one that
inherits from the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened"&gt;Gentoo Hardened
project&lt;/a&gt; now has its main
project page on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, and all
(most) documentation is moved to there as well for the Gentoo Hardened
subprojects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also explained to the folks that I have authored a book on SELinux
System Administration (for Packt Publishing), which was why I was less
active the last few months. However, that is now done so I'm back on
track. More information about the book follows later on my blog ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as usual, klondike has been tweeting the entire meeting through our
&lt;code&gt;@GentooHardened&lt;/code&gt; twitter account ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="irc"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="minutes"></category><category term="progress_report"></category><category term="report"></category></entry><entry><title>And now, 31 days later...</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/08/and-now-31-days-later/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-01T22:43:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-01T22:43:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-08-01:/2013/08/and-now-31-days-later/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;... the &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened"&gt;Gentoo Hardened&lt;/a&gt; team

&lt;p&gt;On the agenda were the usual suspects, such as the &lt;em&gt;toolchain&lt;/em&gt;. In this
category, Zorry mentioned that he has a fix for GCC 4.8.1 for the
&lt;code&gt;hardenedno*&lt;/code&gt; and vanilla &lt;code&gt;gcc-config&lt;/code&gt; options which will be added to
the tree after some more testing. The problem is that with GCC 4.8,
certain settings need to be set sooner than before (in the code path),
which is what the fix focuses on. The ASAN issue is still unresolved,
but otherwise GCC 4.8 is working fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;, the policycoreutils package has been bumped to include
support for &lt;code&gt;mcstrans&lt;/code&gt;, a translation daemon that visualizes humanly
readable strings instead of the standard sensitivity/category sets in
case of MCS/MLS policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding documentation, the wiki team (most notably a3li) is working
hard to support project pages on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo
Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Once we can, we will be moving our
project page with all related documentation to the wiki, allowing for
easier documentation development and a more modern look. To support
this, an XML-to-wiki stylesheet is available that translates ProjectXML
and GuideXML to the wiki language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, we also mentioned the stabilization policy (or at
least, no-longer-stabilization) of the vanilla sources (plain kernel.org
Linux kernel sources). This doesn't immediately effect the hardened
project, but is important to know nonetheless, especially for users of
hardened technologies that are in the main kernel already (like SELinux
or IMA/EVM) as they have to be aware to either use the latest
(regardless of the keywords in use) or switch to gentoo-sources or
(preferably) hardened-sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For uclibc support, the stages will be provided every 2 months rather
than every month as this is a resource-intensive process that isn't
fully automated yet (except for amd64 and x86 which are automated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on PaX and grSecurity support, the XATTR patch for tmpfs is now
in the kernel, and the problem about loosing PaX markings during
installation is fixed as Portage (2.1.12.9 and higher) now preserves the
flags during installation (a wrapper on &lt;code&gt;install&lt;/code&gt; is used that preserves
&lt;code&gt;usr.pax.flags&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="grsecurity"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="irc"></category><category term="irl"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="minutes"></category><category term="pax"></category><category term="project"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="toolchain"></category></entry><entry><title>Gentoo Hardened goes onward (aka project meeting)</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/02/gentoo-hardened-goes-onward-aka-project-meeting/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-07T23:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-02-07T23:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-02-07:/2013/02/gentoo-hardened-goes-onward-aka-project-meeting/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been a while again, so time for another Gentoo Hardened online

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolchain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC 4.8 is on development stage 4, so the hardened patches will be
worked on next week. Some help on it is needed to test the patches on
ARM, PPC and MIPS though. For those interested, keep a close eye on the
hardened-dev overlay as those will contain the latest fixes. When GCC
4.9 starts development phase 1, Zorry will again try to upstream the
patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the coming fixes, we might probably (need to) remove the various
hardenedno* GCC profiles from the hardened Gentoo profiles. This
shouldn't impact too many users as ebuilds add in the correct flags
anyhow (for instance when needing to turn off PIE/PIC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kernel, grSecurity and PaX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel release 3.7.0 that we have stable in our tree has seen a few
setbacks, but no higher version is stable yet (mainly due to the
stabilization period needed). 3.7.4-r1 and 3.7.5 are prime candidates
with good track record,&lt;br&gt;
so we might be stabilizing 3.7.5 in the very near future (next week
probably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the PaX flag migration (you know, from ELF-header based marking to
extended attributes marking), the documentation has seen its necessary
upgrades and the userland utilities have been updated to reflect the use
of xattr markings. The eclass we use for the markings will use the
correct utility based on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue faced when trying to support both markings is that some
actions (like the "paxctl -Cc" which creates the PT_PAX header if it is
missing) make no sense with the other (as there is no header when using
XATTR_PAX). The eclass will be updated to ignore these flags when
XATTR_PAX is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELinux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision 10 is stable in the tree, and revision 11 is waiting
stabilization period. A few more changes have been put in the policy
repository already (which are installed when using the live ebuilds) and
will of course be part of&lt;br&gt;
revision 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change in the userland utilities was also pushed out to allow
permissive domains (so run a single domain in permissive mode instead of
the entire system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SELinux eclass has been updated to remove SELinux modules
from all defined SELinux module stores if the SELinux policy package is
removed from the system. Before that, the user had to remove the modules
from the store himself manually, but this is error-prone and easily
forgotten, especially for the non-default SELinux policy stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All hardened subprofiles are marked as deprecated now (you've seen the
discussions on this on the mailinglist probably on this) so we now have
a sane set of hardened profiles to manage. The subprofiles were used for
things like&lt;br&gt;
"desktop" or "server", whereas users can easily stack their profiles as
they see fit anyhow - so there was little reason for the project to
continue managing those subprofiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, now that Gentoo has released its 13.0 profile, we will need to
migrate our profiles to the 13.0 ones as well. So, the idea is to
temporarily support 13.0 in a subprofile, test it thoroughly, and then
remove the subprofile and switch the main one to 13.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;System Integrity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for IMA and EVM is available on the Gentoo Hardened
project site. They currently still refer to the IMA and EVM subsystems
as development-only, but they are available in the stable kernels now.
Especially the default policy that is available in the kernel is pretty
useful. When you want to consider custom policies (for instance with
SELinux integration) you'll need a kernel patch that is already
upstreamed but not applied to the stable kernels yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support IMA/EVM, a package called ima-evm-utils is available in the
hardened-dev overlay, which will be moved to the main tree soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, the PaX documentation has seen quite a lot of
updates. Other documents that have seen updates are the Hardened FAQ,
Integrity subproject and SELinux documentation although most of them
were small changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion given is to clean up the Hardened project page;
however, there has been some talk within Gentoo to move project pages to
the Gentoo wiki. Such a move might make the suggestion easier to handle.
And while on the subject of the wiki, we might want to move user guides
to the wiki already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bugs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug &lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/443630"&gt;443630&lt;/a&gt; refers to segmentation
faults with libvirt when starting Qemu domains on a SELinux-enabled
host. Sadly, I'm not able to test libvirt myself so either someone with
SELinux and libvirt&lt;br&gt;
expertise can chime in, or we will need to troubleshoot it by bug
(using gdb, strace'ing more, ...) which might take quite some time and
is not user friendly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various talks where held at FOSDEM regarding Gentoo Hardened, and a lot
of people attended those talks. Also the round table was quite
effective, with many users interacting with developers all around. For
next year, chances are very high that we'll give a "What has changed
since last year" session and a round table again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many thanks to the usual suspects: Zorry, blueness, prometheanfire,
lejonet, klondike and the several dozen contributors that are going to
kill me for not mentioning their (nick)names.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="grsecurity"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="kernel"></category><category term="meeting"></category><category term="minutes"></category><category term="online"></category><category term="pax"></category><category term="profiles"></category><category term="selinux"></category></entry></feed>
