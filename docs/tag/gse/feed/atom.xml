(in cooperation with
&lt;a href="http://www.imug.be/events_be/IMUG_LinuxSecurity_Event.asp"&gt;IMUG&lt;/a&gt;) I
gave a small (30 minutes) presentation about what SELinux is. The
&lt;a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/blog/201403/20140325_GSE_SELinux.pdf"&gt;slides are
online&lt;/a&gt;
and cover two aspects of SELinux: some of its design principles, and
then a set of features provided by SELinux. The talk is directed towards
less technical folks - still IT of course, but not immediately involved
in daily operations - so no commands and example/output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELinux came across the board a few times during the entire day. In the
talks about &lt;em&gt;Open Source Security&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Security Guidelines for z/VM and
Linux on System z&lt;/em&gt; SELinux came (of course) up as the technology of
choice for providing in-operating system mandatory access control (on
the zEnterprise' Z/VM level - the hypervisor - this is handled through
RACF Mandatory Access Control) and the &lt;em&gt;Security Enablement on Virtual
Machines&lt;/em&gt; had SELinux in the front line for the sVirt security
protection measures (which focuses on the segregation through MLS
categories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And during the talk about &lt;em&gt;A customer story about logging and audit&lt;/em&gt;,
well, you can guess which technology is also one of the many sources of
logging. Right. SELinux ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if your company is interested in such GSE events, make sure to
follow the &lt;a href="http://www.gsebelux.com"&gt;gsebelux.com&lt;/a&gt; site for updates.
It's a great way for networking as well as sharing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Security"></category><category term="gse"></category><category term="mainframe"></category><category term="s390x"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="zenterprise"></category></entry><entry><title>GSE TWS BeLux 2010</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2010/06/gse-tws-belux-2010/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-03T23:21:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-06-03T23:21:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2010-06-03:/2010/06/gse-tws-belux-2010/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, IBM generously hosted the &lt;a href="http://www.gsebelux.com/?q=node/101"&gt;GSE TWS BeLux 2010

&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, the topic on TWS 8.5.1 with broker functionality was
most impressive. Not that the features are extremely innovative, but
they are very useful (especially in an enterprise context). I don't know
if you have (production) experience with TWS Broker (or even 8.5.1's
broker functionality) - if you do, I'd love to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category><category term="gse"></category><category term="TWS"></category></entry></feed>
