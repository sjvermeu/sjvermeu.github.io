&lt;p&gt;The move to the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Website/Tyrian"&gt;Tyrian&lt;/a&gt; layout,
whose purpose is to eventually become the unified layout for all Gentoo
resources, happened first. Then, three common templates (&lt;code&gt;Code&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;Kernel&lt;/code&gt;) where deprecated in favor of their "*Box" counterparts
(&lt;code&gt;CodeBox&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FileBox&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KernelBox&lt;/code&gt;). These provide better parameter
support (which should make future updates on the templates easier to
implement) as well as syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the wiki also saw a number of contributions being added. I added a
short article on &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Efibootmgr"&gt;Efibootmgr&lt;/a&gt;
as the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page"&gt;Gentoo
handbook&lt;/a&gt; now also uses
it for its EFI related instructions, but other users added quite a few
additional articles as well. As they come along, articles are being
marked by editors for translation. For me, that's a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a wiki article is marked for translations, it shows up on the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Special:PageTranslation"&gt;PageTranslation&lt;/a&gt;
list. When I have time, I pick one of these articles and try to update
it to move to a common style (the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki:Guidelines"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; page
is the "official" one, and I have a
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:SwifT/Styleguide"&gt;Styleguide&lt;/a&gt; in
which I elaborate a bit more on the use). Having a common style gives a
better look and feel to the articles (as they are then more alike),
gives a common documentation development approach (so everyone can join
in and update documentation in a similar layout/structure) and - most
importantly - reduces the number of edits that do little more than
switch from one formatting to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an article has been edited, I mark it for translation, and then the
real workhorse on the wiki starts. We have several active translators on
the Gentoo wiki, who we cannot thank hard enough for their work (I used
to start at Gentoo as a translator, I have some feeling about their
work). They make the Gentoo documentation reachable for a broader
audience. Thanks to the use of the translation extension (kindly offered
by the Gentoo wiki admins, who have been working quite hard the last few
weeks on improving the wiki infrastructure) translations are easier to
handle and follow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of a translation-marked article is that any change on the
article also shows up on the list again, allowing me to look at the
change and perform edits when necessary. For the end user, this is
behind the scenes - an update on an article shows up immediately, which
is fine. But for me (and perhaps other editors as well) this gives a
nice overview of changes to articles (watchlists can only go so far) and
also shows the changes in a simple yet efficient manner. Thanks to this
approach, we can more actively follow up on edits and improve where
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, editing is not always just a few minutes of work. Consider the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GRUB2"&gt;GRUB2&lt;/a&gt; article on the wiki. It was
marked for translation, but had some issues with its style. It was very
verbose (which is not a bad thing, but suggests to split information
towards multiple articles) and quite a few open discussions on its
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Talk:GRUB2"&gt;Discussions&lt;/a&gt; page. I started
editing the article around 13.12h local time, and ended at 19.40h.
Unlike with offline documentation, the entire process of the editing can
be followed through the page'
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/index.php?title=GRUB2&amp;amp;offset=&amp;amp;limit=100&amp;amp;action=history"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;).
And although I'm still not 100% satisfied with the result, it is imo
easier to follow through and read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, don't get me wrong - I do not feel that the article was wrong
in any way. Although I would appreciate articles that immediately follow
a style, I rather see more contributions (which we can then edit towards
the new style) than that we would start penalizing contributors that
don't use the style. That would work contra-productive, because it is
far easier to update the style of an article than to write articles. We
should try and get more contributors to document aspects of their Gentoo
journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, please keep them coming. If you find a lack of (good) information
for something, start jotting down what you know in an article. We'll
gladly help you out with editing and improving the article then, but the
content is something you are probably best to write down.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Documentation"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="wiki"></category></entry><entry><title>Handbooks moved</title><link href="http://blog.siphos.be/2014/12/handbooks-moved/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-14T14:42:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-12-14T14:42:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2014-12-14:/2014/12/handbooks-moved/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the move of the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page"&gt;Gentoo

views&lt;/a&gt;
so that users who want to can view the installation instructions
completely within one view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we use lots of
&lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Transclusion"&gt;transclusions&lt;/a&gt; (i.e.
including different wiki articles inside another article) to support a
common documentation base for the various architectures, I did hit a
limit that prevented me from creating a single-page for the entire
handbook (i.e. "Installing Gentoo Linux", "Working with Gentoo",
"Working with portage" and "Network configuration" together), but I
could settle with one page per part. I think that matches most of the
use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the move now done, it is time to start tackling the various bugs
that were reported against the handbook, as well as initiate
improvements where needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did make a (probably more - but this one is fresh in my memory)
mistake in the move though. I had to do a lot of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;``` {lang="xml"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this, transcluded parts would suddenly show the translation tags
as regular text. Only afterwards (I'm talking about more than &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Documentation/HandbookDevelopment"&gt;400
different
pages&lt;/a&gt;)
did I read that I should transclude the &lt;code&gt;/en&lt;/code&gt; pages (like
&lt;code&gt;Handbook:Parts/Installation/About/en&lt;/code&gt; instead of
&lt;code&gt;Handbook:Parts/Installation/About&lt;/code&gt;) as those do not have the
translation specifics in them.

Next, we cover the various concepts within SELinux. This is mostly

that have been moved, or have seen enough development on the wiki that
they are deemed of proper quality and stable (not too many changes
left). Currently, such documents are (requested to be) marked for
translation, allowing me or other developers to review if the guides are
indeed ok to move forward. If so, they are marked as translatable
(allowing the various translation members on the wiki to move forward
with translating the guides) and will be made part of the overview as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few documents that has not been moved yet is the Gentoo
Handbook as it is of a different format than the guides, and includes
dynamic documentation generation features which I have yet to fully

&lt;p&gt;Examples of already moved documents are the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration"&gt;Xorg configuration

Many more have been moved as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migrations are assisted by a conversion script that translates
GuideXML into wiki style content, although manual corrections remain
needed. For instance, all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre caption="..."&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; stuff is changed into

because the SELinux usage at the firm I work at is most likely going to
grow as well, I decided to join the bunch of documents on SELinux that
are "out there" and start a series of my own. After all, too much
documentation probably doesn't hurt, and SELinux definitely deserves a
lot of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for this
endeavour instead of a GuideXML approach (which is the format used for
Gentoo documentation on the main site). The set of tutorials that I
already wrote can be found under the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux"&gt;SELinux&lt;/a&gt; : &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Tutorials"&gt;Gentoo Hardened
SELinux Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;
location. Although of course meant to support the Gentoo Hardened
SELinux users, I'm hoping to keep the initial set of tutorial articles
deliberately distribution-independent so I can refer to them at work as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now (this is a week's work, so don't expect this amount of tutorials
to double in the next few days) I wrote about the security context of a
process, how SELinux controls file and directory accesses, where to find
SELinux permission denial details, controlling file contexts yourself
and how a process gets into a certain context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I can keep the articles in good shape and with a gradual step-up
in complexity. That does mean that most articles are not complete (for
instance, when talking about domain transitions, I don't talk about
constraints that might prohibit them, or about the role and type
mismatches (invalid context) that you might get, etc.) and that those
details will follow in later articles. Hopefully that allows users to
learn step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each tutorial, you will find a "What you need to remember"
section. This is a very short overview of what was said in the tutorial
and that you will need to know in future articles. If you ever read a
tutorial article, then this section might be sufficient for you to
remember again what it was about - no need to reread the entire article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider it an attempt at a &lt;code&gt;tl;dr&lt;/code&gt; for articles ;-) Enjoy your reading,
and if you have any remarks, don't hesitate to contribute on the wiki or
talk through the "Talk" pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="SELinux"></category><category term="articles"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="tutorials"></category><category term="wiki"></category></entry><entry><title>Transforming GuideXML to wiki</title><link href="http://blog.siphos.be/2013/02/transforming-guidexml-to-wiki/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-12T20:12:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-02-12T20:12:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-02-12:/2013/02/transforming-guidexml-to-wiki/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org"&gt;Gentoo project&lt;/a&gt; has its own &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org"&gt;official

for the regular &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/list.xml"&gt;Gentoo

those guides that we cannot maintain ourselves anymore easily towards
the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support migrations of documents, I created a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sjvermeu/small.coding/blob/master/gxml2docbook/gxml2wiki.xsl"&gt;gxml2wiki.xsl&lt;/a&gt;
stylesheet. Such a stylesheet can be used, together with tools like
&lt;strong&gt;xsltproc&lt;/strong&gt;, to transform GuideXML documents into text output
&lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; suitable for the wiki. It isn't perfect (far from it
actually) but at least it allows for a more simple migration of
documents with minor editing afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, using it is as simple as invoking it against the GuideXML
document you want to transform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;~$ xsltproc gxml2wiki.xsl /path/to/document.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The output shown on the screen can then be used as a page. The following
things still need to be corrected manually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whitespace is broken, sometimes there are too many newlines. I had
    to make the decision to put in newlines when needed (which makes too
    many newlines) rather than a few newlines too few (which makes it
    more difficult to find where to add in).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links need to be double/triple checked, but i'll try to fix that in
    later editions of the stylesheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commands will have "INTERNAL" in them - you'll need to move the
    commands themselves into the proper location and only put the
    necessary output in the pre-tags. This is because the wiki format
    has more structure than GuideXML in this matter, thus
    transformations are more difficult to write in this regard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stylesheet currently automatically adds in a link towards a Server
and security category, but of course you'll need to change that to the
proper category for the document you are converting.&lt;/p&gt;
