&lt;p&gt;I did not modify my key store at all, so what happened?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GnuPG upgrade to 2.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update I did also upgraded GnuPG to the 2.1 series. This version has &lt;a href="https://www.gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html"&gt;quite
a few updates&lt;/a&gt;, one of which is
a change towards a new private key storage approach. I thought that it might have
done a wrong conversion, or that the key which was used was of a particular method
or strength that suddenly wasn't supported anymore (PGP-2 is mentioned in the
article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the key is a relatively standard RSA4096 one. Yet still, when I listed my
private keys, I did not see this key. I even tried to re-import the &lt;code&gt;secring.gpg&lt;/code&gt;
file, but it only found private keys that it already saw previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm blind - the key never disappeared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, when I tried to sign something with the key, &lt;code&gt;gpg-agent&lt;/code&gt; still asked me
for the passphraze that I had used for a while on that key. So it isn't gone. What
happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the key id is not my private key id, but the key id of one of the subkeys.
Previously, &lt;code&gt;gpg-agent&lt;/code&gt; sought and found the private key associated with the subkey,
but now it no longer does. I don't know if this is a bug in the past that I accidentally
used, or if this is a bug in the new version. I might investigate that a bit more,
but right now I'm happy that I found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I had to do was use the right key id in keychain, and things worked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good, now I can continue debugging networking issues with an azure-hosted system...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="gnupg"></category></entry></feed>
