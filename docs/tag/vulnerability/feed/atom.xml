&lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities are a good example of how scale is a cloud threat. Companies
that do not have enough experience with public cloud might not assume this in
their threat models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perimeter controls and isolation domains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before tackling the scale of a cloud service, let's consider an on premise
service. Services that run on premise for a company are often built up
specifically for that company, and have no relationship with other customers of
the same service. Taking the NoSQL example, companies can perfectly run NoSQL
database services on premise that have no internet presence. Moreover, these
services are also often not directly exposed to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running services within your own premises reduces the likelihood that attackers
exploit vulnerabilities of that service. Attackers that are not particularly
eyeballing your company might not know you have that service on premise. Even if
they do know, having proper protections in place should prevent direct access to
those services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="On premise services" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/202109/cloud-scale-on-premise.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some situations do require services to expose themselves to the internet. This
exposure increases the &lt;em&gt;attack surface&lt;/em&gt; for the service significantly.
However, these services are still part of a rather isolated deployment that I
call an &lt;strong&gt;isolation domain&lt;/strong&gt;: a logical aggregation of services that share
one or more integrations and interactions, broadening the scope of
potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate isolation domains imply that vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
that rely on information from the domain cannot spread. This is not the same as
separate deployments or environments, as those often do share certain
integrations. For instance, all NoSQL databases within a company might use that
company's identity provider for federated authentication. But NoSQL databases
exposed to the internet from two completely different companies are often in
separate isolation domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cosmos DB vulnerability exploited the fact that all Cosmos DB deployments
are part of the same isolation domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perimeter and isolation domain challenges for public cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public cloud platform services, like Cosmos DB, are often lacking these two
attributes: they have different perimeter protections in place, and share the
same isolation domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want to imply that public cloud providers do not provide perimeter
protections against their services. They most definitely do, but the scope of
the perimeter is different from what a company would apply. Whereas a company
gains some measurable security by hiding services or ensuring those services are
not reachable from unauthorized contexts, public cloud platform services need to
be easily accessible for the public cloud to become successful. Security
paradigms like &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture"&gt;Zero
Trust&lt;/a&gt; are needed to
raise the security posture of these services. Companies that are building
solutions within the public cloud will find that this requires a different
mindset, and that these environments are not comparable with the traditional
on-premise designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Cosmos DB vulnerability, the FAQ mentions that instances that are not
internet facing are still somewhat impacted (as the credentials could have been
leaked) but accessing the database (by using the credentials) will not be
possible without additional vulnerabilities or misconfigurations being
addressed. This is comparable to an administrator password leakage for your
properly isolated on-premise database: while your database might not be
immediately accessible by attackers, you're still going to change the password
as soon as possible to prevent it from being used in later attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Public cloud platform services" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/202109/cloud-scale-public-cloud.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The isolation domain is a bigger hurdle to take though, as this is almost always
by design. Platform services always share interactions or integrations across
all the customers of the public cloud. Even though you have your own logical
deployment (or even ask for your own physical deployment), the main interface to
access your service is shared. The service you use to authenticate users or
systems is shared (even when it will eventually use federated authentication to
your own identity provider, the initial service is still the same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shared isolation domain makes each public cloud service a fantastic target
for attackers (and luckily also security researchers). Exploits might not just
reveal data or insights from one customer, but from thousands of customers all
over the world. And the bigger the cloud provider, the bigger the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared control planes also imply sharing the isolation domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem of using a shared isolation domain is not restricted to public
cloud platform services only. Even on premise deployments that use a public
control plane are taking part in the same isolation domain as all other
customers of the same service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Control plane also implies sharing isolation domains" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/202109/cloud-scale-control-plane.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you set up a big data platform on premise, but use your vendor's SaaS
service as a control plane to manage this big data platform. This SaaS service
is also used by the other customers of that vendor, so your deployment is part
of the same isolation domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such setups have benefits (such as using the same control plane for
multiple deployments across different environments and even hosting setups, and
not having to manage and maintain the control services yourself) they do
increase the risk exposure in a not dissimilar fashion from the pure public
cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to tackle these concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing about these increased risks (reachability/exposure, and the shared
isolation domain) is the foremost important part that this article wants to
address. Once these risks are considered, companies can start taking
precautions. I've mentioned the zero trust model as a way to address the
reachability/exposure risk. To address the shared isolation domain, reducing the
impact of a successful exploit can be done through proper architecture and
design that uses the "it is not if, but when" principle for cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the data within the databases can use application-level encryption
(meaning the encryption is not done by or through the database, but by the
front-end application that interacts with the database) to reduce the impact of
data leakage through such vulnerabilities. Proper data governance processes
should also be in place to remove any data that is no longer needed on that
database. Active security validations on log data should exist to detect
deviating access patterns, and access controls should be in place to prevent
unauthorized access even from succesfully authenticated users or systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Cosmos DB case, the vulnerability was possible through a selectable
feature: deployments that do not have the Jupyter Notebook feature active would
not leak the credentials. Hence, proper configuration management of services and
disabling features that are not going to be used is paramount for cloud
services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If architects are sufficiently aware of the added risks of public cloud
services, they can properly balance these risks against the benefits of the
public cloud, and make appropriate adjustments to the architecture and design of
the solutions. The main challenge here is to make sure this awareness is raised,
and that this awareness is not only reaching the architects, but also the
engineers and other stakeholders. If not, architects risk that they will be seen
as "innovation inhibitors" if they would recommend changes and improvements to
tackle these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago a vulnerability was reported in the SELinux sandbox user space
utility. The utility is part of the &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils&lt;/code&gt; package. Luckily, Gentoo's
&lt;code&gt;sys-apps/policycoreutils&lt;/code&gt; package is not vulnerable - and not because we were
clairvoyant about this issue, but because we don't ship this utility.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the SELinux sandbox?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SELinux sandbox utility, aptly named &lt;code&gt;sandbox&lt;/code&gt;, is a simple C application which
executes its arguments, but only after ensuring that the task it launches is
going to run in the &lt;code&gt;sandbox_t&lt;/code&gt; domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This domain is specifically crafted to allow applications most standard privileges
needed for interacting with the user (so that the user can of course still use the
application) but removes many permissions that might be abused to either obtain 
information from the system, or use to try and exploit vulnerabilities to gain
more privileges. It also hides a number of resources on the system through
namespaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/28545.html"&gt;developed in 2009&lt;/a&gt; for Fedora
and Red Hat. Given the necessary SELinux policy support though, it was usable on
other distributions as well, and thus became part of the SELinux user space itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the vulnerability about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SELinux sandbox utility used an execution approach that did not shield off
the users' terminal access sufficiently. In the &lt;a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/25/1"&gt;POC post&lt;/a&gt;
we notice that characters could be sent to the terminal through the &lt;code&gt;ioctl()&lt;/code&gt;
function (which executes the ioctl system call used for input/output operations
against devices) which are eventually executed when the application finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's bad of course. Hence the CVE-2016-7545 registration, and of course also
a possible &lt;a href="https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/commit/acca96a135a4d2a028ba9b636886af99c0915379"&gt;fix has been committed upstream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why isn't Gentoo vulnerable / shipping with SELinux sandbox?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some history involved why Gentoo does not ship the SELinux sandbox (anymore).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, Gentoo already has a command that is called &lt;code&gt;sandbox&lt;/code&gt;, installed through
the &lt;code&gt;sys-apps/sandbox&lt;/code&gt; application. So back in the days that we still shipped with
the SELinux sandbox, we continuously had to patch &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils&lt;/code&gt; to use a
different name for the sandbox application (we used &lt;code&gt;sesandbox&lt;/code&gt; then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then we had a couple of security issues with the SELinux sandbox application.
In 2011, &lt;a href="http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-1011/"&gt;CVE-2011-1011&lt;/a&gt;
came up in which the &lt;code&gt;seunshare_mount&lt;/code&gt; function had a security issue. And in 2014,
&lt;a href="http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-3215/"&gt;CVE-2014-3215&lt;/a&gt; came up with - again -
a security issue with &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I had enough of this sandbox utility. First of all, it never quite worked
enough on Gentoo as it is (as it also requires a policy which is not part of the
upstream release) and given its wide open access approach (it was meant to contain
various types of workloads, so security concessions had to be made), I decided to
&lt;a href="http://blog.siphos.be/2014/05/dropping-sesandbox-support/"&gt;no longer support the SELinux sandbox in Gentoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the Gentoo SELinux users ever approached me with the question to add it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is why Gentoo is not vulnerable to this specific issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="SELinux"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="sandbox"></category><category term="gentoo"></category><category term="vulnerability"></category><category term="seunshare"></category></entry><entry><title>Why we do confine Firefox</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2015/08/why-we-do-confine-firefox/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-11T19:18:00+02:00</published><updated>2015-08-11T19:18:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2015-08-11:/2015/08/why-we-do-confine-firefox/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you're a bit following the SELinux development community you will know

principles we focus on in Gentoo Hardened is to
&lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:SELinux/Development_policy#Develop_desktop_policies"&gt;develop desktop policies&lt;/a&gt;
in order to reduce exposure and information leakage of user documents. We might
not have the manpower to confine all desktop applications, but I do think it is
worthwhile to at least attempt to do this, even though what Dan Walsh mentioned
is also correct: desktops are notoriously difficult to use a mandatory access
control system on.&lt;/p&gt;

not have the manpower to confine all desktop applications, but I do think it is
worthwhile to at least attempt to do this, even though what Dan Walsh mentioned
is also correct: desktops are notoriously difficult to use a mandatory access
control system on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Gentoo wants to support more confined desktop applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Gentoo Hardened tries to do is to support the
&lt;a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.8.html"&gt;XDG Base Directory Specification&lt;/a&gt;
for several documentation types. Downloads are marked as &lt;code&gt;xdg_downloads_home_t&lt;/code&gt;,
pictures are marked as &lt;code&gt;xdg_pictures_home_t&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those types defined, we grant the regular user domains full access to
those types, but start removing access to user content from applications. Rules
such as the following are commented out or removed from the policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# userdom_manage_user_home_content_dirs(mozilla_t)
# userdom_manage_user_home_content_files(mozilla_t)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we add in a call to a template we have defined ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;userdom_user_content_access_template(mozilla, { mozilla_t mozilla_plugin_t })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This call makes access to user content optional through SELinux booleans. For
instance, for the &lt;code&gt;mozilla_t&lt;/code&gt; domain (which is used for Firefox), the following
booleans are created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Read generic (user_home_t) user content
mozilla_read_generic_user_content       -&amp;gt;      true

# Read all user content
mozilla_read_all_user_content           -&amp;gt;      false

# Manage generic (user_home_t) user content
mozilla_manage_generic_user_content     -&amp;gt;      false

# Manage all user content
mozilla_manage_all_user_content         -&amp;gt;      false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the default setting is that Firefox can read user content, but
only non-specific types. So &lt;code&gt;ssh_home_t&lt;/code&gt;, which is used for the SSH related
files, is not readable by Firefox with our policy &lt;em&gt;by default&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By changing these booleans, the policy is fine-tuned to the requirements of
the administrator. On my systems, &lt;code&gt;mozilla_read_generic_user_content&lt;/code&gt; is switched
off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask how we can then still support a browser if it cannot access user
content to upload or download. Well, as mentioned before, we support the XDG
types. The browser is allowed to manage &lt;code&gt;xdg_download_home_t&lt;/code&gt; files and
directories. For the majority of cases, this is sufficient. I also don't mind
copying over files to the &lt;code&gt;~/Downloads&lt;/code&gt; directory just for uploading files. But
I am well aware that this is not what the majority of users would want, which
is why the default is as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is much more work to be done sadly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said earlier, the default policy will allow &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; of user files if those
files are not typed specifically. Types that are protected by our policy (but not
by the reference policy standard) includes SSH related files at &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh&lt;/code&gt; and
GnuPG files at &lt;code&gt;~/.gnupg&lt;/code&gt;. Even other configuration files, such as for my Mutt
configuration (&lt;code&gt;~/.muttrc&lt;/code&gt;) which contains a password for an IMAP server I connect
to, are not reachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is still far from perfect. One of the reasons is that many desktop
applications are not "converted" yet to our desktop policy approach. Yes, Chromium
is also already converted, and policies we've added such as for Skype also do not
allow direct access unless the user explicitly enabled it. But Evolution for instance
isn't yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting desktop policies to a more strict setup requires lots of testing, which
translates to many human resources. Within Gentoo, only a few developers and 
contributors are working on policies, and considering that this is not a change
that is already part of the (upstream) reference policy, some contributors also
do not want to put lots of focus on it either. But without having done the works,
it will not be easy (nor probably acceptable) to upstream this (the XDG patch has
been submitted a few times already but wasn't deemed ready yet then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a more restrictive policy isn't the end&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the blog post of Dan rightly mentioned, there are still quite some other
ways of accessing information that we might want to protect. An application 
might not have access to user files, but can be able to communicate (for instance
through DBus) with an application that does, and through that instruct it to
pass on the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugins might require permissions which do not match with the principles set up
earlier. When we tried out Google Talk (needed for proper Google Hangouts support)
we noticed that it requires many, many more privileges. Luckily, we were able to
write down and develop a policy for the Google Talk plugin (&lt;code&gt;googletalk_plugin_t&lt;/code&gt;)
so it is still properly confined. But this is just a single plugin, and I'm sure
that more plugins exist which will have similar requirements. Which leads to more
policy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having workarounds does not make the effort we do worthless. Being able to
work around a firewall through application data does not make the firewall
useless, it is just one of the many security layers. The same is true with SELinux
policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad that we at least try to confine desktop applications more, and

seunshare&lt;/a&gt;,

within &lt;code&gt;libcap-ng&lt;/code&gt; actually, but the specific situation in which the
vulnerability can be exploited is only available in &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;USE …&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3215"&gt;vulnerability in
seunshare&lt;/a&gt;,
part of &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils&lt;/code&gt;, came to light recently (through &lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=509896"&gt;bug
509896&lt;/a&gt;). The issue is
within &lt;code&gt;libcap-ng&lt;/code&gt; actually, but the specific situation in which the
vulnerability can be exploited is only available in &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt; is not built by default on Gentoo. You need to define
&lt;code&gt;USE="sesandbox"&lt;/code&gt;, which I implemented as an optional build because I
see no need for the &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt; command and the &lt;em&gt;SELinux sandbox
(sesandbox)&lt;/em&gt; support. Upstream (Fedora/RedHat) calls it &lt;em&gt;sandbox&lt;/em&gt;, which
Gentoo translates to &lt;em&gt;sesandbox&lt;/em&gt; as it collides with the Gentoo sandbox
support otherwise. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build of the SELinux sandbox support is optional, mostly because we
do not have a direct reason to support it. There are no Gentoo users
that I'm aware of that use it. It is used to start an application in a
chroot-like environment, based on Linux namespaces and a specific
SELinux policy called &lt;code&gt;sandbox_t&lt;/code&gt;. The idea isn't that bad, but I rather
focus on proper application confinement and full system enforcement
support (rather than specific services). The SELinux sandbox makes a bit
more sense when the system supports unconfined domains (and users are in
the &lt;code&gt;unconfined_t&lt;/code&gt; domain), but Gentoo focuses on strict policy support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this isn't the first vulnerability in &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt;. In 2011,
another privilege escalation vulnerability was found in the application
(see &lt;a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=374897"&gt;bug 374897&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having a vulnerability in the application (or its interaction with
&lt;code&gt;libcap-ng&lt;/code&gt;) doesn't mean an exploitable vulnerability. Most users will
not even have &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt;, and those that do have it will not be able to
call it if you are running with SELinux in &lt;em&gt;strict&lt;/em&gt; or have
&lt;code&gt;USE="-unconfined"&lt;/code&gt; set for the other policies. If &lt;code&gt;USE="unconfined"&lt;/code&gt; is
set and you run &lt;em&gt;mcs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;targeted&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mls&lt;/em&gt; (which isn't default either,
the default is &lt;em&gt;strict&lt;/em&gt;) then if your users are still mapped to the
regular user domains (&lt;code&gt;user_t&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;staff_t&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;sysadm_t&lt;/code&gt;) then
&lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt; doesn't work as the SELinux policy prevents its behavior
before the vulnerability is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a &lt;em&gt;targeted&lt;/em&gt; policy with users mapped to
&lt;code&gt;unconfined_t&lt;/code&gt; and you have built &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils&lt;/code&gt; with
&lt;code&gt;USE="sesandbox"&lt;/code&gt; or you run in SELinux in permissive mode, then please
tell me if you can trigger the exploit. On my systems, &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt; fails
with the message that it can't drop its privileges and thus exits
(instead of executing the exploit code as it suggested by the reports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I mentioned that most user don't use SELinux sandbox, and because
I can't even get it to work (regardless of the vulnerability), I decided
to drop support for it from the builds. That also allows me to more
quickly introduce the new userspace utilities as I don't need to
refactor the code to switch from &lt;code&gt;sandbox&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;sesandbox&lt;/code&gt; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils-2.2.5-r4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;policycoreutils-2.3_rc1-r1&lt;/code&gt; are now
available which do not build &lt;code&gt;seunshare&lt;/code&gt; anymore. And now I can focus on
providing the full &lt;em&gt;2.3&lt;/em&gt; userspace that has been announced today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="Gentoo"></category><category term="hardened"></category><category term="policycoreutils"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="seunshare"></category><category term="vulnerability"></category></entry><entry><title>Looking at the local Linux kernel privilege escalation</title><link href="https://blog.siphos.be/2013/05/looking-at-the-local-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-17T03:50:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-05-17T03:50:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sven Vermeulen</name></author><id>tag:blog.siphos.be,2013-05-17:/2013/05/looking-at-the-local-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been a few posts already on the local Linux kernel privilege

&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1eb9iw/sdfucksheeporgs_semtexc_local_linux_root_exploit/c9ykrck"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;
that Brad Spengler made on the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the vulnerability is an &lt;em&gt;out-of-bound&lt;/em&gt; access to an array
within the Linux perf code (which is a performance measuring subsystem
enabled when &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS&lt;/code&gt; is enabled). This subsystem is often
enabled as it offers a wide range of performance measurement techniques
(see &lt;a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;its wiki&lt;/a&gt; for
more information). You can check on your own system through the kernel
configuration (&lt;strong&gt;zgrep CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS /proc/config.gz&lt;/strong&gt; if you
have the latter pseudo-file available - it is made available through
&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public exploit maps memory in userland, fills it with known data,
then triggers an out-of-bound decrement that tricks the kernel into
decrementing this data (mapped in userland). By looking at where the
decrement occurred, the exploit now knows the base address of the array.
Next, it targets (through the same vulnerability) the IDT base
(Interrupt Descriptor Table) and targets the overflow interrupt vector.
It increments the top part of the address that the vector points to
(which is 0xffffffff, becoming 0x00000000 thus pointing to the
userland), maps this memory region itself with shellcode, and then
triggers the overflow. The shell code used in the public exploit
modifies the credentials of the current task, sets uid/gid with root and
gives full capabilities, and then executes a shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Brad mentions, &lt;a href="https://grsecurity.net/~spender/uderef.txt"&gt;UDEREF&lt;/a&gt;
(an option in a grSecurity enabled kernel) should mitigate the attempt
to get to the userland. On my system, the exploit fails with the
following (start of) oops (without affecting the system further) when it
tries to close the file descriptor returned from the syscall that
invokes the decrement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 1926.226678] PAX: please report this to pageexec@freemail.hu

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploit also finds that the decrement didn't succeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second mitigation is that
&lt;a href="http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/PaXTeam-H2HC12-PaX-kernel-self-protection.pdf"&gt;KERNEXEC&lt;/a&gt;
(also offered through grSecurity) which prevents the kernel from
executing data that is writable (including userland data). So modifying
the IDT would be mitigated as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important mitigation is TPE - &lt;em&gt;Trusted Path Execution&lt;/em&gt;. This
feature prevents the execution of binaries that are not located in a
root-owned directory and owned by a trusted group (which on my system is
10 = wheel). So users attempting to execute such code will fail with a
&lt;em&gt;Permission denied&lt;/em&gt; error, and the following is shown in the logs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 3152.165780] grsec: denied untrusted exec (due to not being in trusted group and file in non-root-owned directory) of /home/user/test by /home/user/test[bash:4382] uid/euid:1000/1000 gid/egid:100/100, parent /bin/bash[bash:4352] uid/euid:1000/1000 gid/egid:100/100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even though a nicely hardened system should be fairly immune
against the currently circling public exploit, it should be noted that
it is not immune against the vulnerability itself. The methods above
mentioned make it so that that particular way of gaining root access is
not possible, but it still allows an attacker to decrement and increment
memory in specific locations so other exploits might be found to modify
the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now out-of-bound vulnerabilities are not new. Recently (february this
year), a
&lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=MTMxMTg"&gt;vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;
in the networking code also provided an attack vector to get a local
privilege escalation. A mandatory access control system like SELinux has
little impact on such vulnerabilities if you allow users to execute
their own code. Even confined users can modify the exploit to disable
SELinux (since the shell code is ran with ring0 privileges it can access
and modify the SELinux state information in the kernel).&lt;/p&gt;

about the recent &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/support/security/faq/2013-04-04/"&gt;PostgreSQL
vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When correctly configured, the PostgreSQL daemon will run in the
&lt;code&gt;postgresql_t&lt;/code&gt; domain. In SELinux-speak, a domain can be seen as a name
granted to a set of permissions (what is allowed) and assigned to one or
more processes. A process that "runs in domain postgresql_t" will be
governed by the policy rules (what is and isn't allowed) for that
domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability we speak of is about creating new files or overwriting
existing files, potentially corrupting the database itself (when the
database files are overwritten). Creating new files is handled through
the &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; privilege on files (and &lt;em&gt;add_name&lt;/em&gt; on directories),
writing into files is handled through the &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; privilege. Given
certain circumstances, one could even &lt;a href="http://blog.blackwinghq.com/2013/04/08/2/"&gt;write commands inside
files&lt;/a&gt; that are executed by
particular users on the system (btw, the link gives a great explanation
on the vulnerability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's look at what SELinux does and could have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current situation, as we explained, &lt;code&gt;postgresql_t&lt;/code&gt; is the only
domain we need to take into account (the PostgreSQL policy does not use
separate domains for the runtime processes). Let's look at what
directory labels it is allowed to write into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sesearch -s postgresql_t -c dir -p add_name -SCATd
Found 11 semantic av rules:
   allow postgresql_t postgresql_log_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t var_log_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t var_lock_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t tmp_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t postgresql_tmp_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t postgresql_var_run_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t postgresql_db_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t etc_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t tmpfs_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t var_lib_t : dir { add_name } ; 
   allow postgresql_t var_run_t : dir { add_name } ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the PostgreSQL service is allowed to create files inside directories
labeled with one of the following labels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;postgresql_log_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for PostgreSQL log files
    (&lt;code&gt;/var/log/postgresql&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;var_log_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for the generic log files (&lt;code&gt;/var/log&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;var_lock_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for lock files (&lt;code&gt;/run/lock&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/var/lock&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmp_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for the temporary file directory (&lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; or
    &lt;code&gt;/var/tmp&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;postgresql_tmp_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for the PostgreSQL temporary
    files/directories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;postgresql_var_run_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for the runtime information (like
    PID files) of PostgreSQL (&lt;code&gt;/var/run/postgresql&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;postgresql_db_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for the PostgreSQL database files
    (&lt;code&gt;/var/lib/postgresql&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;etc_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for the generic system configuration files (&lt;code&gt;/etc/&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;var_lib_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for the &lt;code&gt;/var/lib&lt;/code&gt; data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;var_run_t&lt;/code&gt;, used for the &lt;code&gt;/var/run&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/run&lt;/code&gt; data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to this, depending on the label of the directory, the PostgreSQL
service is allowed to write into files with the following label assigned
(of importance to both creating new files as well as overwriting
existing ones):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sesearch -s postgresql_t -c file -p write -SCATd

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an exploit creates a new file, the &lt;em&gt;add_name&lt;/em&gt; permission on the
directory is needed. If otoh the exploit is overwriting existing files,
I think the only permission needed here is the &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; on the files
(also &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; but all the writes have &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; as well in the above case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now accessing and being able to write files into the database file
directory is expected - it is the functionality of the server, so unless
we could separate domains more, this is a "hit" we need to take. Sadly
though, this is also the label used for the PostgreSQL service account
home directory here (not sure if this is for all distributions), making
it more realistic that an attacker writes something in the home
directory &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt; file and hopes for the administrator to do
something like &lt;strong&gt;su postgres -&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;code&gt;etc_t&lt;/code&gt; write privileges also worry me, not mainly because it
can write there, but also because I can hardly understand why -
PostgreSQL is supposed to run under its own, non-root user (luckily) so
unless there are &lt;code&gt;etc_t&lt;/code&gt; labeled directories owned by the PostgreSQL
service account (or world writeable - please no, kthx). And this isn't
an "inherited" permission from something - the policy currently has
&lt;code&gt;files_manage_etc_files(postgresql_t)&lt;/code&gt; set, and has been since 2005 or
earlier. I'm really wondering if this is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress. Given that there are no PostgreSQL-owned directories nor
world-writeable ones in &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;, let's look at a few other ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;security_t&lt;/code&gt; is used for the SELinux pseudo file system, and is used
    for the SEPostgreSQL support. From the looks of it, only the root
    Linux user has the rights to do really harmful things on this file
    system (and only if he too has write permissions on &lt;code&gt;security_t&lt;/code&gt;),
    non-root should be limited to verifying if contexts exist or have
    particular rights. Still, I might investigate this further as I'm
    intrigued about many of the pseudo files in &lt;code&gt;/sys/fs/selinux&lt;/code&gt; that
    I'm not fully sure yet what they deal with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmp_t&lt;/code&gt; should not be a major concern. Most (if not all) daemons and
    services that use temporary files have file transitions to their own
    type so that access to these files, even if it would be allowed by
    regular permissions, is still prohibited by SELinux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;lastlog_t&lt;/code&gt; is also a weird one, again because it shouldn't be
    writeable for anyone else but root accounts; if succesfull, an
    attacker can overwrite the lastlog information which might be used
    by some as a means for debugging who was logged on when (part
    of forensics).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the information above, it is a bit sad to see that SELinux can't
protect PostgreSQL users from this particular vulnerability - most of
the "mitigation" (if any) is because the process runs as non-root to
begin with (which is another hint at users not to think SELinux is
sufficient to restrict the permissions of processes). But could it have
been different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, yes, and I'll see if we can learn from it for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we should do more policy code auditing. It might not be
easy to remove policy rules generally, but we should at least try. I use
a small script that enables auditing (SELinux auditing, so &lt;em&gt;auditallow&lt;/em&gt;
statements) for the entire domain, and then selectively disables
auditing until I get no hits anymore. The remainder of &lt;em&gt;auditallow&lt;/em&gt;
statements warrant a closer look to see if they are still needed or not.
I'll get onto that in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we might want to have service accounts use a different home
directory, where they do have the necessary search privileges for, but
no write privileges. Exploits that write stuff into a home directory
(hoping for a &lt;strong&gt;su postgresql -&lt;/strong&gt;) are then mitigated a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we might want to look into separating the domains according to
the architecture of the service. This requires intimate knowledge of the
ins and outs of PostgreSQL and might even require PostgreSQL patching,
so is not something light. But if no patching is needed (such as when
all process launches are done using known file executions) we could have
a separate domain for the master process, server processes and perhaps
even the various subfunction processes (like the WAL writer, BG writer,
etc.). The Postfix service has such a more diverse (but also complex)
policy. Such a subdomain structure in the policy might reduce the risk
if the vulnerable process (I think this is the master process) does not
need to write to database files (as this is handled by other processes),
so no &lt;code&gt;postgresql_db_t&lt;/code&gt; write privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If others have ideas on how we can improve service security (for
instance through SELinux policy development) or knows of other exploits
related to this vulnerability that I didn't come across yet, please give
a comment on it below.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Security"></category><category term="postgresql"></category><category term="selinux"></category><category term="vulnerability"></category></entry></feed>
