            <p>Many organizations struggle with the all-time increase in IP address
allocation and the accompanying need for segmentation. In the past, governing
the segments within the organization means keeping close control over the
service deployments, firewall rules, etc.</p>
<p>Lately, the idea of micro-segmentation, supported through software-defined
networking solutions, seems to defy the need for a segmentation governance.
However, I think that that is a very short-sighted sales proposition. Even
with micro-segmentation, or even pure point-to-point / peer2peer communication
flow control, you'll still be needing a high level overview of the services
within your scope.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I'll give some insights in how we are approaching this in
the company I work for. In short, it starts with requirements gathering,
creating labels to assign to deployments, creating groups based on one or two
labels in a layered approach, and finally fixating the resulting schema and
start mapping guidance documents (policies) toward the presented architecture.</p>


<p><strong>As always, start with the requirements</strong></p>
<p>From an infrastructure architect point of view, creating structure is one way
of dealing with the onslaught in complexity that is prevalent within the wider
organizational architecture. By creating a framework in which infrastructural
services can be positioned, architects and other stakeholders (such as
information security officers, process managers, service delivery owners, project
and team leaders ...) can support the wide organization in its endeavor of
becoming or remaining competitive.</p>
<p>Structure can be provided through various viewpoints. As such, while creating
such framework, the initial intention is not to start drawing borders or
creating a complex graph. Instead, look at attributes that one would assign
to an infrastructural service, and treat those as labels. Create a nice
portfolio of attributes which will help guide the development of such framework.</p>
<p>The following list gives some ideas in labels or attributes that one can use.
But be creative, and use experienced people in devising the "true" list of
attributes that fits the needs of your organization. Be sure to describe them
properly and unambiguously - the list here is just an example, as are the
descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>tenant</strong> identifies the organizational aggregation of business units which are
  sufficiently similar in areas such as policies (same policies in use),
  governance (decision bodies or approval structure), charging, etc. It
  could be a hierarchical aspect (such as organization) as well.</li>
<li><strong>location</strong> provides insight in the physical (if applicable) location of the
  service. This could be an actual building name, but can also be structured
  depending on the size of the environment. If it is structured, make sure to
  devise a structure up front. Consider things such as regions, countries,
  cities, data centers, etc. A special case location value could be the
  jurisdiction, if that is something that concerns the organization.</li>
<li><strong>service type</strong> tells you what kind of service an asset is. It can be a
  workstation, a server/host, server/guest, network device, virtual or
  physical appliance, sensor, tablet, etc.</li>
<li><strong>trust level</strong> provides information on how controlled and trusted the service
  is. Consider the differences between unmanaged (no patching, no users doing
  any maintenance), open (one or more admins, but no active controlled
  maintenance), controlled (basic maintenance and monitoring, but with still
  administrative access by others), managed (actively maintained, no privileged
  access without strict control), hardened (actively maintained, additional
  security measures taken) and kiosk (actively maintained, additional security
  measures taken and limited, well-known interfacing).</li>
<li><strong>compliance set</strong> identifies specific compliance-related attributes, such as the
  PCI-DSS compliancy level that a system has to adhere to.</li>
<li><strong>consumer group</strong> informs about the main consumer group, active on the service.
  This could be an identification of the relationship that consumer group has
  with the organization (anonymous, customer, provider, partner, employee, ...)
  or the actual name of the consumer group.</li>
<li><strong>architectural purpose</strong> gives insight in the purpose of the service in
  infrastructural terms. Is it a client system, a gateway, a mid-tier system,
  a processing system, a data management system, a batch server, a reporting
  system, etc.</li>
<li><strong>domain</strong> could be interpreted as to the company purpose of the system. Is it for
  commercial purposes (such as customer-facing software), corporate functions
  (company management), development, infrastructure/operations ...</li>
<li><strong>production status</strong> provides information about the production state of a
  service. Is it a production service, or a pre-production (final testing before
  going to production), staging (aggregation of multiple changes) or development
  environment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the final set of labels, the next step is to aggregate results to create
a high-level view of the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a layered structure</strong></p>
<p>Chances are high that you'll end up with several attributes, and many of these
will have multiple possible values. What we don't want is to end in an
N-dimensional infrastructure architecture overview. Sure, it sounds sexy to do
so, but you want to show the infrastructure architecture to several stakeholders
in your organization. And projecting an N-dimensional structure on a
2-dimensional slide is not only challenging - you'll possibly create a projection
which leaves out important details or make it hard to interpret.</p>
<p>Instead, we looked at a <em>layered approach</em>, with each layer handling one or two
requirements. The top layer represents the requirement which the organization
seems to see as the most defining attribute. It is the attribute where, if its
value changes, most of its architecture changes (and thus the impact of a service
relocation is the largest).</p>
<p>Suppose for instance that the domain attribute is seen as the most defining one:
the organization has strict rules about placing corporate services and commercial
services in separate environments, or the security officers want to see the
commercial services, which are well exposed to many end users, be in a separate
environment from corporate services. Or perhaps the company offers commercial
services for multiple tenants, and as such wants several separate "commercial
services" environments while having a single corporate service domain.</p>
<p>In this case, part of the infrastructure architecture overview on the top level
could look like so (hypothetical example):</p>
<p><img alt="Top level view" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/201706/07-1-toplevelview.png"></p>
<p>This also shows that, next to the corporate and commercial interests of the
organization, a strong development support focus is prevalent as well. This
of course depends on the type of organization or company and how significant
in-house development is, but in this example it is seen as a major decisive
factor for service positioning.</p>
<p>These top-level blocks (depicted as locations, for those of you using Archimate)
are what we call "<strong>zones</strong>". These are not networks, but clearly bounded areas in
which multiple services are positioned, and for which particular handling rules
exist. These rules are generally written down in policies and standards - more
about that later.</p>
<p>Inside each of these zones, a substructure is made available as well, based on
another attribute. For instance, let's assume that this is the architectural
purpose. This could be because the company has a requirement on segregating
workstations and other client-oriented zones from the application hosting related
ones. Security-wise, the company might have a principle where mid-tier services
(API and presentation layer exposures) are separate from processing services,
and where data is located in a separate zone to ensure specific data access or
more optimal infrastructure services.</p>
<p>This zoning result could then be depicted as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="Detailed top-level view" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/201706/07-1-detailedtoplevel.png"></p>
<p>From this viewpoint, we can also deduce that this company provides separate
workstation services: corporate workstation services (most likely managed
workstations with focus on application disclosure, end user computing, etc.)
and development workstations (most likely controlled workstations but with more
open privileged access for the developer).</p>
<p>By making this separation explicit, the organization makes it clear that the
development workstations will have a different position, and even a different
access profile toward other services within the company.</p>
<p>We're not done yet. For instance, on the mid-tier level, we could look at the
consumer group of the services:</p>
<p><img alt="Mid-tier explained" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/201706/07-1-midtier.png"></p>
<p>This separation can be established due to security reasons (isolating services
that are exposed to anonymous users from customer services or even partner
services), but one can also envision this to be from a management point of
view (availability requirements can differ, capacity management is more
uncertain for anonymous-facing services than authenticated, etc.)</p>
<p>Going one layer down, we use a production status attribute as the defining
requirement:</p>
<p><img alt="Anonymous user detail" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/201706/07-1-anonymousdetail.png"></p>
<p>At this point, our company decided that the defined layers are sufficiently
established and make for a good overview. We used different defining properties
than the ones displayed above (again, find a good balance that fits the company
or organization that you're focusing on), but found that the ones we used were
mostly involved in existing policies and principles, while the other ones are
not that decisive for infrastructure architectural purposes. </p>
<p>For instance, the tenant might not be selected as a deciding attribute, because
there will be larger tenants and smaller tenants (which could make the resulting
zone set very convoluted) or because some commercial services are offered toward
multiple tenants and the organizations' strategy would be to move toward
multi-tenant services rather than multiple deployments.</p>
<p>Now, in the zoning structure there is still another layer, which from an
infrastructure architecture point is less about rules and guidelines and more
about manageability from an organizational point of view. For instance, in the
above example, a SAP deployment for HR purposes (which is obviously a corporate
service) might have its Enterprise Portal service in the <code>Corporate Services</code> &gt; 
<code>Mid-tier</code> &gt; <code>Group Employees</code> &gt; <code>Production</code> zone. However, another service such as
an on-premise SharePoint deployment for group collaboration might be in <code>Corporate
Services</code> &gt; <code>Mid-tier</code> &gt; <code>Group Employees</code> &gt; <code>Production</code> zone as well. Yet both
services are supported through different teams.</p>
<p>This "final" layer thus enables grouping of services based on the supporting
team (again, this is an example), which is organizationally aligned with the
business units of the company, and potentially further isolation of services
based on other attributes which are not defining for all services. For instance,
the company might have a policy that services with a certain business impact
assessment score must be in isolated segments with no other deployments within
the same segment.</p>
<p><strong>What about management services</strong></p>
<p>Now, the above picture is missing some of the (in my opinion) most important
services: infrastructure support and management services. These services do not
shine in functional offerings (which many non-IT people generally look at) but
are needed for non-functional requirements: manageability, cost control,
security (if security can be defined as a non-functional - let's not discuss
that right now).</p>
<p>Let's first consider <em>interfaces</em> - gateways and other services which are
positioned between zones or the "outside world". In the past, we would speak of
a demilitarized zone (DMZ). In more recent publications, one can find this as
an interface zone, or a set of Zone Interface Points (ZIPs) for accessing and
interacting with the services within a zone.</p>
<p>In many cases, several of these interface points and gateways are used in the
organization to support a number of non-functional requirements. They can be
used for intelligent load balancing, providing virtual patching capabilities,
validating content against malware before passing it on to the actual services,
etc.</p>
<p>Depending on the top level zone, different gateways might be needed (i.e.
different requirements). Interfaces for commercial services will have a strong
focus on security and manageability. Those for the corporate services might be
more integration-oriented, and have different data leakage requirements than
those for commercial services.</p>
<p>Also, inside such an interface zone, one can imagine a substructure to take
place as well: egress interfaces (for communication that is exiting the zone),
ingress interfaces (for communication that is entering the zone) and internal
interfaces (used for routing between the subzones within the zone).</p>
<p>Yet, there will also be requirements which are company-wide. Hence, one could
envision a structure where there is a company-wide interface zone (with
mandatory requirements regardless of the zone that they support) as well as a
zone-specific interface zone (with the mandatory requirements specific to that
zone).</p>
<p>Before I show a picture of this, let's consider <em>management services</em>. Unlike
interfaces, these services are more oriented toward the operational management
of the infrastructure. Software deployment, configuration management, identity
&amp; access management services, etc. Are services one can put under management
services.</p>
<p>And like with interfaces, one can envision the need for both company-wide
management services, as well as zone-specific management services.</p>
<p>This information brings us to a final picture, one that assists the
organization in providing a more manageable view on its deployment landscape.
It does not show the 3rd layer (i.e. production versus non-production
deployments) and only displays the second layer through specialization
information, which I've quickly made a few examples for (you don't want to make
such decisions in a few hours, like I did for this post).</p>
<p><img alt="General overview" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/201706/07-1-firstgeneral.png"></p>
<p>If the organization took an alternative approach for structuring (different
requirements and grouping) the resulting diagram could look quite different:</p>
<p><img alt="Alternative general overview" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/201706/07-1-secondgeneral.png"></p>
<p><strong>Flows, flows and more flows</strong></p>
<p>With the high-level picture ready, it is not a bad idea to look at how flows
are handled in such an architecture. As the interface layer is available on
both company-wide level as well as the next, flows will cross multiple zones.</p>
<p>Consider the case of a corporate workstation connecting to a reporting server
(like a Cognos or PowerBI or whatever fancy tool is used), and this reporting
server is pulling data from a database system. Now, this database system is
positioned in the <code>Commercial</code> zone, while the reporting server is in the
<code>Corporate</code> zone. The flows could then look like so:</p>
<p><img alt="Flow example" src="https://blog.siphos.be/images/201706/07-1-flow.png"></p>
<p><sub>Note for the Archimate people: I'm sorry that I'm abusing the flow relation
here. I didn't want to create abstract services in the locations and then use
the "serves" or "used by" relation and then explaining readers that the arrows
are then inverse from what they imagine.</sub></p>
<p>In this picture, the corporate workstation does not connect to the reporting
server directly. It goes through the internal interface layer for the corporate
zone. This internal interface layer can offer services such as reverse proxies
or intelligent load balancers. The idea here is that, if the organization
wants, it can introduce additional controls or supporting services in this
internal interface layer without impacting the system deployments themselves
much.</p>
<p>But the true flow challenge is in the next one, where a processing system
connects to a data layer. Here, the processing server will first connect to the
egress interface for corporate, then through the company-wide internal
interface, toward the ingress interface of the commercial and then to the data
layer.</p>
<p>Now, why three different interfaces, and what would be inside it?</p>
<p>On the corporate level, the egress interface could be focusing on privacy
controls or data leakage controls. On the company-wide internal interface more
functional routing capabilities could be provided, while on the commercial
level the ingress could be a database activity monitoring (DAM) system such as
a database firewall to provide enhanced auditing and access controls.</p>
<p>Does that mean that all flows need to have at least three gateways? No, this is
a functional picture. If the organization agrees, then one or more of these
interface levels can have a simple pass-through setup. It is well possible that
database connections only connect directly to a DAM service and that such flows
are allowed to immediately go through other interfaces.</p>
<p>The importance thus is not to make flows more difficult to provide, but to
provide several areas where the organization can introduce controls.</p>
<p><strong>Making policies and standards more visible</strong></p>
<p>One of the effects of having a better structure of the company-wide deployments
(i.e. a good zoning solution) is that one can start making policies more clear,
and potentially even simple to implement with supporting tools (such as
software defined network solutions).</p>
<p>For instance, a company might want to protect its production data and establish
that it cannot be used for non-production use, but that there are no
restrictions for the other data environments. Another rule could be that
web-based access toward the mid-tier is only allowed through an interface.</p>
<p>These are simple statements which, if a company has a good IP plan, are easy to
implement - one doesn't need zoning, although it helps. But it goes further
than access controls.</p>
<p>For instance, the company might require corporate workstations to be under
heavy data leakage prevention and protection measures, while developer
workstations are more open (but don't have any production data access). This
not only reveals an access control, but also implies particular minimal
requirements (for the <code>Corporate</code> &gt; <code>Workstation</code> zone) and services (for the
<code>Corporate</code> interfaces).</p>
<p>This zoning structure does not necessarily make any statements about the
location (assuming it isn't picked as one of the requirements in the
beginning). One can easily extend this to include cloud-based services or
services offered by third parties.</p>
<p>Finally, it also supports making policies and standards more realistic. I often
see policies that make bold statements such as "all software deployments must
be done through the company software distribution tool", but the policies don't
consider development environments (production status) or unmanaged, open or
controlled deployments (trust level). When challenged, the policy owner might
shrug away the comment with "it's obvious that this policy does not apply to
our sandbox environment" or so.</p>
<p>With a proper zoning structure, policies can establish the rules for the right
set of zones, and actually pin-point which zones are affected by a statement.
This is also important if a company has many, many policies. With a good zoning
structure, the policies can be assigned with meta-data so that affected roles
(such as project leaders, architects, solution engineers, etc.) can easily get
an overview of the policies that influence a given zone.</p>
<p>For instance, if I want to position a new management service, I am less
concerned about workstation-specific policies. And if the management service is
specific for the development environment (such as a new version control system)
many corporate or commercially oriented policies don't apply either.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The above approach for structuring an organization is documented here in a
high-level manner. It takes many assumptions or hypothetical decisions which
are to be tailored toward the company itself. In my company, a different zoning
structure is selected, taking into account that it is a financial service
provider with entities in multiple countries, handling several thousand of
systems and with an ongoing effort to include cloud providers within its
infrastructure architecture.</p>
<p>Yet the approach itself is followed in an equal fashion. We looked at
requirements, created a layered structure, and finished the zoning schema. Once
the schema was established, the requirements for all the zones were written out
further, and a mapping of existing deployments (as-is) toward the new zoning
picture is on-going. For those thinking that it is just slideware right now -
it isn't. Some of the structures that come out of the zoning exercise are
already prevalent in the organization, and new environments (due to mergers and
acquisitions) are directed to this new situation.</p>
<p>Still, we know we have a large exercise ahead before it is finished, but I
believe that it will benefit us greatly, not only from a security point of
view, but also clarity and manageability of the environment.</p>

    "description": "Many organizations struggle with the all-time increase in IP address allocation and the accompanying need for segmentation. In the past, governing the segments within the organization means keeping close control over the service deployments, firewall rules, etc. Lately, the idea of micro-segmentation, supported through software-defined networking solutions, seems to defy the need for a segmentation governance. However, I think that that is a very short-sighted sales proposition. Even with micro-segmentation, or even pure point-to-point / peer2peer communication flow control, you'll still be needing a high level overview of the services within your scope. In this blog post, I'll give some insights in how we are approaching this in the company I work for. In short, it starts with requirements gathering, creating labels to assign to deployments, creating groups based on one or two labels in a layered approach, and finally fixating the resulting schema and start mapping guidance documents (policies) toward the presented architecture."
